      "Passage": "CAT 2019\n\nScientists recently discovered that Emperor Penguins—one of Antarctica’s most celebrated species—employ a particularly unusual technique for surviving the daily chill. As detailed in an article published today in the journal Biology Letters, the birds minimize heat loss by keeping the outer surface of their plumage below the temperature of the surrounding air. At the same time, the penguins’ thick plumage insulates their body and keeps it toasty. . . .\n\nThe researchers analyzed thermographic images . . . taken over roughly a month during June 2008. During that period, the average air temperature was 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit. At the same time, the majority of the plumage covering the penguins’ bodies was even colder: the surface of their warmest body part, their feet, was an average 1.76 degrees Fahrenheit, but the plumage on their heads, chests and backs were -1.84, -7.24 and -9.76 degrees Fahrenheit respectively. Overall, nearly the entire outer surface of the penguins’ bodies was below freezing at all times, except for their eyes and beaks. The scientists also used a computer simulation to determine how much heat was lost or gained from each part of the body—and discovered that by keeping their outer surface below air temperature, the birds might paradoxically be able to draw very slight amounts of heat from the air around them. The key to their trick is the difference between two different types of heat transfer: radiation and convection.\n\nThe penguins do lose internal body heat to the surrounding air through thermal radiation,just as our bodies do on a cold day. Because their bodies (but not surface plumage) are warmer than the surrounding air, heat gradually radiates outward over time, moving from a warmer material to a colder one. To maintain body temperature while losing heat, penguins, like all warm-blooded animals, rely on the metabolism of food. The penguins, though, have an additional strategy. Since their outer plumage is even colder than the air, the simulation showed that they might gain back a little of this heat through thermal convection—the transfer of heat via the movement of a fluid (in this case, the air). As the cold Antarctic air cycles around their bodies, slightly warmer air comes into contact with the plumage and donates minute amounts of heat back to the penguins, then cycles away at a slightly colder temperature.\n\nMost of this heat, the researchers note, probably doesn’t make it all the way through the plumage and back to the penguins’ bodies, but it could make a slight difference. At the very least, the method by which a penguin’s plumage wicks heat from the bitterly cold air that surrounds it helps to cancel out some of the heat that’s radiating from its interior. And given the Emperors’ unusually demanding breeding cycle, every bit of warmth counts. . . . Since [penguins trek as far as 75 miles to the coast to breed and male penguins] don’t eat anything during [the incubation period of 64 days], conserving calories by giving up as little heat as possible is absolutely crucial.",

      "Passage": "CAT 2019\n\nContemporary internet shopping conjures a perfect storm of choice anxiety. Research has consistently held that people who are presented with a few options make better, easier decisions than those presented with many. . . . Helping consumers figure out what to buy amid an endless sea of choice online has become a cottage industry unto itself. Many brands and retailers now wield marketing buzzwords such as curation, differentiation, and discovery as they attempt to sell an assortment of stuff targeted to their ideal customer. Companies find such shoppers through the data gold mine of digital advertising, which can catalog people by gender, income level, personal interests, and more. Since Americans have lost the ability to sort through the sheer volume of the consumer choices available to them, a ghost now has to be in the retail machine, whether it’s an algorithm, an influencer, or some snazzy ad tech to help a product follow you around the internet. Indeed, choice fatigue is one reason so many people gravitate toward lifestyle influencers on Instagram—the relentlessly chic young moms and perpetually vacationing 20-somethings—who present an aspirational worldview, and then recommend the products and services that help achieve it. . . .\nFor a relatively new class of consumer-products start-ups, there’s another method entirely. Instead of making sense of a sea of existing stuff, these companies claim to disrupt stuff as Americans know it. Casper (mattresses), Glossier (makeup), Away (suitcases), and many others have sprouted up to offer consumers freedom from choice: The companies have a few aesthetically pleasing and supposedly highly functional options, usually at mid-range prices. They’re selling nice things, but maybe more importantly, they’re selling a confidence in those things, and an ability to opt out of the stuff rat race. . . .\nOne-thousand-dollar mattresses and $300 suitcases might solve choice anxiety for a certain tier of consumer, but the companies that sell them, along with those that attempt to massage the larger stuff economy into something navigable, are still just working within a consumer market that’s broken in systemic ways. The presence of so much stuff in America might be more valuable if it were more evenly distributed, but stuff’s creators tend to focus their energy on those who already have plenty. As options have expanded for people with disposable income, the opportunity to buy even basic things such as fresh food or quality diapers has contracted for much of America’s lower classes.\nFor start-ups that promise accessible simplicity, their very structure still might eventually push them toward overwhelming variety. Most of these companies are based on hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital, the investors of which tend to expect a steep growth rate that can’t be achieved by selling one great mattress or one great sneaker. Casper has expanded into bedroom furniture and bed linens. Glossier, after years of marketing itself as no-makeup makeup that requires little skill to apply, recently launched a full line of glittering color cosmetics. There may be no way to opt out of stuff by buying into the right thing.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2019\n\nSustaining Versus Disruptive InnovationSuccessful companies, no matter what the sourceof their capabilities, are pretty good at responding to evolutionarychangesin their markets-what in The Innovator’s Dilemma (Harvard Business School, 1997), Clayton Christensenreferred to as sustaining innovation.\n\n Where they run into trouble is in handingor initiating revolutionary changesin theirmarkets, or dealing with disruptive innovation (DI).Sustaining technologies are innovations that make a product or service perform better in waysthat customers in themainstream market already value. Compaq’s early adoption ofIntel’s 32-bit 386 microprocessor instead of the 16-bit286 chip was a sustaining innovation. So was Merrill Lynch's introduction of its Cash Management Account, whichallowed customers to write checks against their equity accounts. Those were breakthrough innovations that sustainedthe best customersof these companies by providing somethingbetter than had previously been available.\n\nDisruptive innovations create an entirely new market through the introduction of a new kind of product or service, onethat’s actually worse,initially, as judged by the performance metrics that mainstream customers value. CharlesSchwab's initial entry as a bare-bones discount broker was a disruptive innovationrelative to the offeringsof full-servicebrokers like Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch’s best customers wanted more than Schwab-like services. Early personalcomputers were a disruptive innovation relative to mainframes and minicomputers. PCs were not powerful enough torun the computing applications that existed at the time they were introduced. These innovations were disruptive inthat they didn’t address the next-generation needs of leading customers in existing markets. They had otherattributes, of course, that enabled new market applications to emerge-andthe disruptive innovations improvedsorapidly that they ultimately could address the needs of customers in the mainstream of the marketas well.\n\nSustaining innovations are nearly always developed and introduced byestablished industry leaders. But those samecompanies never introduce-or cope well with-disruptive innovations. Why? Our resources-processes-valuesframeworkholds the answer. Industry leaders are organized to develop andintroduce sustaining technologies. Monthafter month,yearafter year, they launch new and improved products to gain an edge over the competition. They do soby developing processes for evaluating the technological potential of sustaining innovations andfor assessing theircustomers’ needs for alternatives. Investmentin sustaining technology also fits in with the values of leading companiesin that they promise higher margins from better products sold to leading-edge customers.\n\nDisruptive innovations occur so intermittently that no company has a routine process for handling them. Furthermore,because disruptive products nearly always promise lower profit margins per unit sold andare notattractive to thecompany’s best customers, they’ re inconsistent with the established company’s values. Merrill Lynch had theresources-the people, money and technology-required to succeed at the sustaining innovations (Cash ManagementAccount) and the disruptive innovations (bare-bones discount brokering) that it has confronted in recent history. But itsprocesses and values supported only the sustaining innovation : they became disabilities when the company needed tounderstand and confront the discount and on-line brokerage businesses.\n\nThe reason,therefore, that large companies often surrender emerging growth markets is that smaller, disruptivecompaniesare actually more capable of pursuing them.Start-ups lack resources, but that doesn’t matter. Their valuescan embrace small markets, and their cost structures canaccommodate low margins. Their market research and resource allocation processes allow managers toproceedintuitively; every decision need notbe backed bycareful research andanalysis. All these advantages add uptothe ability to embrace and eveninitiate disruptive change.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2019\n\nA few years ago I was on myboat with one of my employees, a great guy named Keenon; I was supposed to be givinghim pep talk and performance review.\n\n“WhenI think of what we do, I describe it as uncovering the riptide”, I said.\n\n“Uncovering the riptide,” Keenon said.\n\n“Yes, the idea is that we - you and I and everyonehere - havetheskills to identify the psychologicalforces that are pulling us away from shore and use them to get somewhere more productive.”\n\n“Somewhere more productive,” Keenonsaid.\n\n“Exactly,” I said. “To a place where wecan...”\n\nWe had talked for about forty-five minutes when my son Brandon, whoruns operations for theBlack Swan Group,broke out laughing.\n\n“I can’t take it anymore! Don’t you see ? Really, Dad, don’t you see ?” I blinked. Did I see what ?I asked him.\n\n“All Keenonis doing is mirroring you. And he’s been doing it for almost an hour.” “Oh,” I said, my face going red as Keenon began to laugh.\n\nHe was totally right. Keenon had been playing with me the entire time, using the psychological tool that works most effectively with assertive guys like me: the mirror. Your personal negotiation style - and that of your counterpart - isformed through childhood, schooling, family, culture and a million other factors; by recognizing it you can identifyyour negotiating strengths and weaknesses (and those of your counterpart) and adjust your mind-set and strategiesaccordingly. Negotiation style is a crucial variable in bargaining. If you don’t know what instinct will tell you or theother side to do in various circumstances, you'll have massive trouble gaming out effective strategies and tactics. Youand your counterpart have habits of mind and behaviour, and once you identify them you can leverage them in astrategic manner. Just like Keenon did.\n\nThere’s an entire library unto itself of research into the archetypes and behavioral profiles of all the possible peopleyou're bound to meet at the negotiating table.It’s flat-out overwhelming, so much so that it loses its utility. Over thelast few years, in an effort primarily led by my son Brandon, we've consolidated and simplified all that research, cross-referencing it with our experiences in the field and the case studies of our business school students, and found thatpeople fall into three broad categories. Some people are Accommodators; others—like me—are basically Assertive;and the rest are data-loving Analysts.\n\nAccommodators think that as long as there is a free-flowing continuous exchangeof information time is being wellspent. They will yield a concession to appease or acquiesce and hope the other side reciprocates. The Assertive typebelieves time is money. For them, getting the solution perfect isn’t as important as getting it done. Assertives are fierypeople who love winning above all else, often at the expense of others. Analysts are methodical and diligent. They arenot in a big rush. Instead, they believe that as long as they are working toward the best result in a thoroughand systematic way, time is of little consequence. Their self-image is linked to minimizing mistakes. Their motto is : Asmuch time as it takes to getit right.\n\nA study of American lawyer-negotiators found that 65 percent of attorneys from two major U.S. cities used acooperative style while only 24 percent were truly assertive. And when these  lawyers were graded for effectiveness,more than 75 percent of the effective group came from the cooperative type; only 12 percent were Assertive. So ifyou’re not Assertive, don’t despair. Blunt assertion is actually counter productive most of the time.\n\nRemember, your personal negotiating style is not a straitjacket. No one is exclusively one style. Most of us have thecapacity to throttle up our non-dominant styles should the situation call for it. But there is one basic truth about asuccessful bargaining style : To be good, you have to learn to be yourself at the bargaining table. To be great you haveto add to your strengths, not replace them.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2019\n\nRead the passage and answer the questions.Much debate surrounds which kind of political system best achieves a functioning market economy with strongprotection for property rights. People in the west tend to associate a representative democracy with a marketeconomic system, strong property rights protection, and economic progress. Building on this, we tend to argue thatdemocracy is good for growth. However, some totalitarian regimes have fostered a market economy and strongproperty rights protection and have experienced rapid economic growth. Five of the fastest-growing economies of the past 30 years - China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong- had one thing in common at the start of theireconomic growth : undemocratic governments. At the same time, countries with stable democratic governments, suchas India, experienced sluggish economic growth for long periods. In 1992, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s leader for manyyears, told an audience, “I do not believe that democracy necessarily leads to development.I believe that a countryneeds to develop discipline more than democracy. The exuberance of democracy leads to undisciplined anddisorderly conduct which is inimical to development.”\n\nHowever, those who argue for the value of a totalitarian regime miss an important point: If dictators made countriesrich, then much of Africa, Asia, and Latin America should have been growing rapidly during 1960 to 1990, and this wasnot the case. Only a totalitarian regime that is committed to a market system and strong protection of property rightsis capable of promoting economic growth. Also, there is no guarantee that a dictatorship will continue to pursuesuch progressive policies. Dictators are rarely benevolent. Many are tempted to use the apparatus of the state tofurther their own private ends, violating property rights and stalling economic growth. Given this, it seems likely thatdemocratic regimes are far more conducive to long-term economic growth than are dictatorships, even benevolentones. Only in a well-functioning, mature democracyare property rights truly secure. Nor should we forget Amartya Sen’s arguments where he says that states, by limitinghuman freedom, also suppress human development and therefore are detrimental to progress\n\nWhile it is possible to argue that democracy is not a necessary precondition for a free market economy in whichproperty rights are protected, subsequent economic growth often leads to establishment of a democratic regime.Several of the fastest-growing Asian economics adopted more democratic governments during the past three decades,including South Korea and Taiwan, Thus, although democracy may not always be the cause of initial economicprogress,it seems to be one consequence of that progress.\n\n",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2019\n\nJapan presents an interesting case study of how culture can influence competitive advantage. Some scholars haveargued that the culture of modern Japan lowers the costs of doing business relative to the costs in most Westernnations. Japan’s emphasis on group affiliation, loyalty, reciprocal obligations, honesty, and education all boost thecompetitiveness of Japanese companies. The emphasis on group affiliation and loyalty encourage individuals to identifystrongly with the companies in which they work. This tends to foster an ethic of hard work and cooperationbetween management and labour “for the good of the company.” Similarly, reciprocal obligation and honesty helpfoster an atmosphere of trust between companies and their suppliers. This encourages them to enter into long-termrelationships with each other to work on inventory reduction, quality control, and design - all of which have beenlacking in West, where the relationship between a company and its suppliers tends to be a short-term one structuredaround competitive bidding rather than one based on long-term mutual commitments. In addition, the availability of a pool of highly skilled labor, particularly engineers, has helped Japanese enterprises develop cost-reducing, processinnovations that have boosted their productivity. Thus, cultural factors may help explain the success enjoyed by manyJapanese businesses in the global market place. Most notably,it has been argued that the rise of Japan as an economicpower during the second half of the twentieth century may be in part attributed to the economic consequences of its culture.\n\nIt also has been argued that the Japanese culture is less supportive of entrepreneurial activity than, say Americansociety. In many ways entrepreneurial activity is a product of an individualistic mind-set, not a classic characteristic ofthe Japanese. This may explain why American enterprises, rather than Japanese corporations, dominate industrieswhere entrepreneurship and innovation are highly valued, such as computer software and biotechnology. Of course,obvious and significant exceptions to this generalization exist. Masayoshi Son recognized the potential of softwarefar faster than any of Japan’s corporate giants; set up his company, Soft bank, in 1981; and over the past 30 years hasbuilt it into Japan’s top software distributor. Similarly, dynamic entrepreneurial individuals established major Japanesecompanies such as Sony and  Matsushita. But these examples maybe the exceptions that prove the rule, for as yetthere has been no surge in entrepreneurial high-technology enterprises in Japan equivalent to what has occurred in theUnited States.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2018\n\nWe use the word culture quite casually when referring to a variety of thoughts and actions. I would like to begin myattempt to define cultures by a focus on three of its dictionary meanings that I think are significant to ourunderstanding of the general term-culture. We often forget that it's more essential usage is as a verb rather than as anoun, since the noun follows froth the activities involved in the verb. Thus the verb, to culture, means to cultivate. Thiscan include at least three activities: to artificially grow microscopic organisms; to improve and refine the customs,manners and activities of one's life; to give attention to the mind as part of what goes into the making of what we callcivilization, or what was thought to be the highest culture. In short, one might argue that culture is the intervention ofhuman effort in refining and redefining that which is natural, but that it gradually takes on other dimensions in the lifeof the individual, and even more in the interface between the individual and society. When speaking of society, thisword also requires defining. Society, it has been said, is what emerges from a network of interactions between peoplethat follow certain agreed upon and perceptible patterns. These arc determined by ideas of status, hierarchy and asense of community governing the network. They are often, but not invariably, given a direction by those who controlthe essentials in how a society functions, as for instance, its economic resources, its technology and its value systems.The explanation and justification for who controls these aspects of a society introduces the question of its ideology andoften its form.\n\nThe resulting patterns that can be differentiated from segment to segment of the society are frequently called itscultures. Most early societies register inequalities, The access of their members to wealth and status varies. The ideaof equality therefore has many dimensions. All men and women may be said to be equal in the eyes of god, but may atthe same time be extremely differentiated in terms of income and social standing, and therefore differentiated in theeyes of men and women. This would not apply to the entire society. There may be times when societies conform to agreater degree of equality, but such times may be temporary. It has been argued that on a pilgrimage, the status ofevery pilgrim is relatively similar but at the end returns to inequalities. Societies are not static and change their formsand their rules of functioning. Cultures are reflections of these social patterns, so they also change. My attempt in thisintroduction is to explain how the meaning of a concept such as culture has changed in recent times and has come toinclude many more facets than it did earlier. What we understand as the markers of culture have gone way beyondwhat we took them to be a century or two ago. Apart from items of culture, which is the way in which culture asheritage was popularly viewed, there is also the question of the institutions and social codes that determine thepattern of living, and upon which pattern a culture is constructed. Finally, there is the process of socialization intosociety and culture through education. There is a historical dimension to each of these as culture and history aredeeply intertwined. There is also an implicit dialogue between the present and the past reflected in the way in whichthe readings of the past changed over historical periods.\n\nEvery. society has its cultures, namely, the patterns of how the people of that society live. In varying degrees thiswould refer to broad categories that shape life, such as the environment that determines the relationship with thenatural world, technology that enables a control over the natural world, political-economy that organizes the largervision of a society as a community or even as a state, structures of social relations that ensure its networks offunctioning, religion that appeals to aspirations and belief, mythology that may get transmuted into literature andphilosophy that teases the mind and the imagination with questions. The process of growth is never static thereforethere are mutations and changes within the society. There is communication and interaction with other societiesthrough which cultures evolve and mutate. There is also the emergence of subcultures that sometimes take the formof independent and dominant cultures or amoeba-like breakaway to form new cultures. Although cultures coincide withhistory and historical change, the consciousness of a category such as culture, in the emphatic sense in which the termis popularly used these days, emerges in the eighteenth century in Europe. The ideal was the culture of elite groups,therefore sometimes a distinction is made between what carne to be called 'high culture' that of the elite, and lowculture' that of those regarded as not being of the elite, and sometimes described as 'popular'. Historical records ofelite cultures in forms such as texts and monuments for instance, received larger patronage and symbolized thepatterns of life of dominant groups. They were and are more readily available as heritage than the objects of thesocially lower groups in society whose less durable cultural manifestations often do not survive. This also predisposedpeople to associate culture as essentially that of the elite.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2018\n\nToday, we have specialists in various professions, but many among them are unconcerned with the world beyond theirown specialization. It is sometimes said that they arc replacing the public intellectual. But the two are not identical.There are many more academics, for instance, than existed before. But it seems that most refer not to confrontauthority even if it obstructs the path of free thought. Is this because they wish to pursue knowledge undisturbed, orbecause they are ready to discard knowledge should authority require them to do so? Or does association withnational or international agencies require that critical assessments of social thought and action remain sotto voce?Today, as always, he public intellectual is expected to take a position independent of those in power, enabling him orher to question debatable ideas, irrespective of who propagates them. Reasoned critiques are often the essentialstarting point. The public intellectual has to see himself or herself as a person who is as close to being autonomous asis possible, and more than that, be seen by others as such.\n\nAn knowledged professional status makes it somewhat easier to be autonomous. Such status brings with it anotherkind of authority, conceded, even if grudgingly, by professional peers and this does make some small impact on thenon-professional world. The public intellectual of today, in addition to being of such a tatus, has to have at the sametime a concern for what constitutes the rights of citizens. particularly on issues of social justice, and further, thereshould be a readiness to raise these matters as public policy. The combination of drawing upon the professionalrespect that a person has garnered, together with a concern for society, can sometimes establish the moral authorityof that person and ensure public support. This is a conceded qualification and not a tangible one. In the past it wasthose who had distanced themselves somewhat from society who were believed not to have a vested interest in thechanges they were suggesting. Although this was not always so, we know that close associations, such as formalaffiliation to a political party, can inhibit free-thinking and criptions for action, even if it has the advantage of providinga certain leverage to the suggestions being ade. As an attitude of mind, autonomy is more readily expected of theprofessional specialist or the demic. Such persons, and they are not the only ones, can suggest alternative ways ofthinking, even about ems of the larger society. Their thinking should emerge from reasoned, logical analyses. Yetacademics today are hesitant to defend even the right to make what might be broadly called alternative, if not rationalinterpretations, however sensitively they may be xpressed. This is evident from the ease with which books arc bannedand pulped, or demands made that they be burned, and syllabuses changed under pressure from religious or politicalorganizations, or the intervention of the state. Why do such actions provoke so little reaction among many academicsand professionals? The answer that is usually given is that they fear the instigators who arc persons with the backingof political authority. But is this the only answer?\n\nIs it assumed that opinions about governance and society must hinge on ideologies linked to political parties and as aresult there can be no thinking about how to configure society in a manner that is independent of a necessarycommitment to political parties? Surely in this day and age, it is possible to he an independent liberal in this countrywith ideological commitments that arc not determined solely by political parties? Being a liberal is an attitude of mindthat determines the fight for space in a society when that society resists ethics and reasoned thinking. Theunderstanding of what one is battling for assumes an ideological direction but this does not require association with apolitical party. And there should also be the freedom to choose one's position on an issue and this position need not bein conformity with the ideological take of a particular political party on every occasion. The public intellectual has, bydefinition, to be liberal, that is, to insist that there be space to present varying perspectives and that whereverpossible, reason and ethics should have primacy in whatever debates are taking place. This is not a new definition andhas been a recognizable part of the interface between knowledge and society since earliest times. Approximations toorthodoxy and orthopraxy have always been contested by similar approximations to heterodoxy although thoseleading the charge do not always have or need to have the same social identity. This is apparent among people andsituations in the Indian past yet we have often ignored it or failed to recognize it. How an intellectual even withoutbeing a public intellectual, requires a more than average knowledge in his/her professional specialization and beyondthat a familiarity with the context of that knowledge: how did it come about and what arc the implications for thepeople who use that knowledge. To be a technician (or be technically accomplished) in a specialization, however good,is not sufficient. An intellectual perspective requires that the specialized knowledge one possesses should be relatedto social concerns where required and to other branches of knowledge as well. Added to this it helps if that knowledgecan be contextualized in an accessible way for a wider range of people to understand facets of the variegated world inwhich we live, and to which understanding the specialization contributes. The public intellectual uses such foundationsin his/her thinking in order to extend the understanding of the world we inhabit, and to do so by insisting on space fordebate and the right to informed opinion.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2018\n\nWe love information. Especially in times of crisis. Have you ever noticed your tendency to become glued to thetelevision or Internet when disaster strikes? It is human nature to try to gather as much information as possible, tomake sense and create meaning when we don't understand what is happening. We seek information for anotherreason too, control. We operate under the illusion that if we can gain more information, we will not only understandwhat is happening, we might just be able to control it. I am not suggesting that there is no value to information or toclearly defined reporting and accountability relationships for routine business operations. I am instead calling out thetemptation that an information-centred approach to agility offers: there's a desire to settle into the illusion thatinformation will give you control, when in many situations it is simply not possible to gather or process enoughinformation to be effective when it counts.\n\nRecognizing that there are many situations that you not only cannot control but cannot predict is a radical mind-setand practice shift for most. It requires that you decide whether your goal is to reduce the perception of uncertainty or o actually become more effective in its midst. It also involves more than a simple reconfiguration of the organisationchart and job descriptions. It require relinquishing the illusion of control that lies at the very foundation of mostmanagement training and business practice. This shift is being made in one of the most hierarchal, command-and-control organizations in the country, the United States military. Recognizing the insidious nature of information agestrategies and their tendency to lead to either analysis paralysis or the false security of convenient stories, the U.S.military has begun to make a fundamental shift in its approach to VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, andambiguity), a shift from information to interactions. This change does not begin with restructuring and redeploymentsbut with a fundamental shift in mind-set. In fact, the term. VUCA was first coined by the U.S. Army War College todescribe increasingly complex and unpredictable combat conditions. VUCA has become shorthand for the reality oflife in the twenty-first century. Most business approaches to VUCA focus on strategies to reduceuncertainty. These strategies tend to centre around gaining greater control, including amassing more and betterinformation, minimizing risk, and improving planning and analysis. While risk and uncertainty reduction are validstrategies, they do not necessarily make an organization more agile, for two reasons: ( 1) collecting more and betterinformation takes time and may foster the illusion of control and comfort when, in reality, it is impossible to gather allavailable information in complex, changing contexts, let alone fully analyze and make meaning of, it and (2) planningand analysis are dependent on relatively stable contexts. Another liability of information-centred approaches is thatthey typically lead to more questions and the need to gather more information to reduce the uncertainty created bythe information already collected. There is an even more significant liability of the information-centred approach toagility: our preconceptions lead us to filter out information that does not align with our expectations. Under the stressof an unexpected challenge or opportunity, our ability to access our higher thinking capacity can be reduced, leadingus to fall back on the version of the story we expected. Warnings of terrorist threats before 9/11 and potentialmalfunctions of crucial components prior to the Challenger space shuttle disaster went unheeded because they did notfit the narrative that was co-constructed by leaders during years of experience and expectation. Agile leaders, teamsand organizations know they cannot afford to get caught up in a story. They arc instead learning how they might be more effective by focusing on their interactions with one another and with theavailable information in the dynamic present moment. \n\nLet me emphasize that this is a shift away from an overreliance on information. I am not suggesting you curtailimportant industry and market data analysis, or take this as encouragement to blindly make decisions when furtherinvestigation is warranted. I am encouraging you to shift away from the false comfort such information can offer, andtoward the relational context in which you make sense of it, decide and act. When we make the shift from informationto interaction, we may be called to shift more than our relationship to external information; we may need to shift theway we perceive ourselves as well. The agility shift requires that we value our capacity to connect and buildrelationships over-or at least as much' as-our hard-won expertise. Years of experience, training and credentials are, ofcourse, still valuable. But their value is minimal without the networks to which the skills, knowledge, experience, andresource awareness are linked. In other words, separating the process of 'knowing what' and 'knowing how' from the process of 'knowing who' significantly diminishes agility capacity. The shift from information to interaction values thehuman system in which all meaning and action take place. Rather than problematizing this system as non-objective ormessy, the agility shift embraces it and engages it more fully. You may not be able to control or predict what happens.but with a conscious, continuous commitment to interacting within your web of relationships and resources, you will bemore effective than you ever imagined. The agility shift is first and foremost a shift in mind-set. This mind-set valuesinteractions within the dynamic present moment. It is also a shift from the false comfort of 'a plan' to achieving astate of readiness to find opportunity in the unexpected.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2018\n\nWhile majoring in computer science isn't a requirement to participate in the Second Machine Age, what skills do liberalarts graduates specifically possess to contribute to this brave new world? Another major oversight in the debate hasbeen the failure to appreciate that a good liberal arts education teaches many skills that are not only valuable to thegeneral world of business, but are in fact vital to innovating the next wave of breakthrough tech-driven products andservices. Many defenses of the value of a liberal arts education have been launched, of course, with the emphasisbeing on the acquisition of fundamental thinking and communication skills, such as critical thinking, logicalargumentation, and good communication skills. One aspect of liberal arts education that has been strangely neglectedin the discussion is the fact that the humanities and social sciences are devoted to the study of human nature and thenature of our communities and larger societies. Students who pursue degrees in the liberal arts disciplines tend to beparticularly motivated to investigate what makes us human: how we behave and why we behave as we do. They'redriven to explore how our families and our public institutions-such as our schools and legal systems-operate, and couldoperate better, and how governments and economies work, or as is so often the case, are plagued by dysfunction.\n\nhese students learn a great deal from their particular courses of study and apply that knowledge to today's issues, theleading problems to be tackled, and various approaches for analyzing and addressing those problems. The greatest opportunities for innovation in the emerging era are in applying evolving technological capabilities tofinding better ways to solve human problems like social dysfunction and political corruption; finding ways to bettereducate children; helping people live healthier and happier lives by altering harmful behaviors; improving our workingconditions; discovering better ways to tackle poverty; Improving healthcare and making it more affordable; making ourgovernments more accountable, from the local level up to that of global affairs; and finding optimal ways toincorporate intelligent, nimble machines into our work lives so that we are empowered to do more of the work that wedo best, and to let the machines do the rest. Workers with a solid liberal arts education have a strong foundation tobuild on in pursuing these goals. One of the most immediate needs in technology innovation is to invest products and services with more human qualities. with more sensitivity to human needs and desires. Companies andentrepreneurs that want to succeed today and in the future must learn to consider in all aspects of their product andservice creation how they can make use of the new technologies to make them more humane. Still, many other liberalarts disciplines also have much to provide the world of technological innovation. The study of psychology, for example,can help people build products that are more attuned to our emotions and ways of thinking. Experience inAnthropology can additionally help companies understand cultural and individual behavioural factors that should beconsidered in developing products and in marketing them. As technology allows for more machine intelligence and ourlives become increasingly populated by the Internet of things and as the gathering of data about our lives and analysisof it allows for more discoveries about our behaviour, consideration of how new products and services can be craftedfor the optimal enhancement of our lives and the nature of our communities, workplaces and governments will be ofvital importance. Those products and services developed with the keeneSt sense of how they' can serve our humanneeds and complement our human talents will have a distinct competitive advantage. Much of the criticism of theliberal arts is based on the false assumption that liberal arts students lack rigor in comparison to those participating inthe STEM disciplines and that they are 'soft' and unscientific whereas those who study STEM fields learn the scientificmethod. In fact the liberal arts teach many methods of rigorous inquiry and analysis, such as close observation andinterviewing in ways that hard science adherents don't always appreciate. Many fields have long incorporated thescientific method and other types of data driven scientific inquiry and problem solving. Sociologists have developedsophisticated mathematical models of societal networks. Historians gather voluminous data on centuries-oldhousehold expenses, marriage and divorce rates, and the world trade, and use data to conduct statistical analyses,identifying trends and contributing factors to the phenomena they are studying. Linguists have developed high-techmodels of the evolution of language, and they've made crucial contributions to the development of one of thetechnologies behind the rapid advance of automation- natural language processing, whereby computers are able tocommunicate with the, accuracy and personality of Siri and Alexa. It's also important to debunk the fallacy that liberalarts students who don't study these quantitative analytical methods have no 'hard' or relevant skills. This gets us backto the arguments about the fundamental ways of thinking, inquiring, problem solving and communicating that a liberalarts education teaches.",

      "Passage": "IIFT 2018\n\n For policy makers to this day. GDP remains the definitive yardstick for economic performance, permitting them toassess the health and progress of a nation's economy and, by extension, people's lives. Yet GDP's dominance hasbrought criticism. It fails to capture changes to an economy's structure, such as the shifts to a service-led ortechnology-based economy. Some have protested that it fails to capture the unofficial or black market economy.Others have asserted that any purely economic indicator by itself may be inadequate to truly measure society'sprogress. It is therefore no surprise that over the last several decades, economists, • sociologists, and other academicshave devised other metrics for tracking happiness, well-being, and social progress, some of which have garnered asubstantial following. Implicit in these metrics is a challenge to GDP as the dominant measure of human progress-despite the fact that these measures sometimes themselves rely on GDP or some variance of GDP and come withlimitations of their own. Even so, GDP remains a compelling measure of economic as well as social progress inasmuchas improvements in economic GDP translate into social progress. Policymakers have nevertheless become interestedin these alternative measures, which, even if they do not displace GDP as the most prominent measure of economicgrowth, have value in complementing GDP in future assessments for economic and living standard progress.Furthermore, these proposed additions to GDP remind us that the endgame for public policy is progress and improvedliving standards rather than GDP growth for growth's sake. Nonetheless. these rankings reveal that consistently richerCountries (in terms of GDP) rank at the top of the indices and poorer ones at the bottom. For example, happinessindices reflect a demand that happiness be recognized as a criterion for government policy. First published in 2012,the World Happiness Report measures happiness by indexing GDP per capita alongside social support, life expectancy,freedom, generosity, and the absence of corruption. Of the 155 Countries collated in the 2017 World floppiness Report,the ten happiest countries, in descending order, are Norway. Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland. Finland, the Netherlands,Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden. The ten least happy countries, beginning with the least happy, are theCentral African Republic, Burundi, Tanzania, Syria, Rwanda, Togo, Guinea, Liberia, South Sudan, and Yemen: While theUnited States is the largest country in GDP terms, it ranks fourteenth on the 2017 happiness index. A more traditional measure that goes beyond GDP alone is the United Nations' Human Development Index (HIM). First published in 1990,the HDI assesses longevity, education, and income across each nation's population, on the premise that people andtheir capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growthalone. The HDI reveals how two countries with the same level of gross national income (GNI)-that is, the totaldomestic output (GDP) plus foreign GDP generated by citizens abroad, minus domestic output created by foreigners-can end up with such different outcomes. In this way, it allows observers to compare the relative effectiveness ofdifferent policy choices and capital investments. In this index, Norway, Australia. and Switzerland rank at the top, withGNIs above USS40,000, and the Central African Republic, Niger, and Chad arc at the bottom of the index, all with GNIsof less than US$2,000 per capita. Some of these measures move beyond individuals and attempt a holistic assessmentof the health of society. Since its founding in 2012, the Social Progress Imperative has offered a Social Progress Indexthat examines a range of social and environmental indicators beyond GDP, from access to electricity to religioustolerance; to measure three distinct dimensions of social progress: Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, andOpportunity. The 2017 Social Progress Index covers 133 countries and 94 percent of the world's population. The worldas a whole would score 64.85 in Social Progress based on an average of all countries. On average, the top cluster offourteen countries ranked as having very high social progress-including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, andSwitzerland among others-scores 94.92 on Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and Opportunity. Thecluster of seven countries described as having' very low social progress include the Central African Republic,Afghanistan. Chad, Angola, Niger, Guinea, and Yemen. For this cluster the average dimension scores of Basic HumanNeeds, Foundations of Wellbeing, and Opportunity are 42.67, 45.42, and 27.74. What can we learn from these variousindices? While noneconomic factors such as health, well-being, and quality of life matter to humanity, economicmeasures such as GDP generally correlate to success in the other areas, with a small amount of variation among thosewho are awarded the top spot. In a nutshell, economic growth underpins all else; a country needs economic growth toachieve happiness, well-being, and ultimately human progress. To be sure, GDP estimates provide a snapshot of GDPat a single point in time, but nothing more. A large GDP can indicate that a country is rich yet mask that its economymight be struggling and scarcely growing.",

      "Passage": "In all battles two things are usually required of the Commander-in-Chief: to make a good plan for his army and to keep a strong reserve. Both of these are also obligatory for the painter. To make a plan, thorough reconnaissance of the country where the battle is to be fought is needed. Its fields, its mountains, its rivers, its bridges, its trees, its flowers, its atmosphere—all require and repay attentive observation from a special point of view.\n\nI think this is one of the chief delights that have come to me through painting. No doubt many people who are lovers of art have acquired it to a high degree without actually practicing. But I expect that nothing will make one observe more quickly or more thoroughly than having to face the difficulty of representing the thing observed. And mind you, if you do observe accurately and with refinement, and if you do record what you have seen with tolerable correspondence, the result follows on the canvas with startling obedience.\n\nBut in order to make his plan, the General must not only reconnoiter the battle-ground; he must also study the achievements of the great Captains of the past. He must bring the observations he has collected in the field into comparison with the treatment of similar incidents by famous chiefs.\n\nConsidering that, the galleries of Europe take on a new—and to me at least a severely practical—interest. “This, then, is how —— painted a cataract. Exactly, and there is that same light I noticed last week in the waterfall at ——.” And so on. You see the difficulty that baffled you yesterday; and you see how easily it has been overcome by a great or even by a skillful painter. Not only is your observation of Nature sensibly improved and developed, but also your comprehension of the masterpieces of art.\n\nBut it is in the use and withholding of their reserves that the great commanders have generally excelled. After all, when once the last reserve has been thrown in, the commander’s part is played. If that does not win the battle, he has nothing else to give. Everything must be left to luck and to the fighting troops. But these last reserves, in the absence of high direction, are apt to get into sad confusion, all mixed together in a nasty mess, without order or plan—and consequently without effect.\n\nMere masses count no more. The largest brush, the brightest colors cannot even make an impression. The pictorial battlefield becomes a sea of mud mercifully veiled by the fog of war. Even though the General plunges in himself and emerges bespattered, as he sometimes does, he will not retrieve the day. In painting, the reserves consist in Proportion or Relation. And it is here that the art of the painter marches along the road which is traversed by all the greatest harmonies in thought. At one side of the palette there is white, at the other black; and neither is ever used ‘neat.’ Between these two rigid limits all the action must lie, all the power required must be generated. Black and white themselves placed in juxtaposition make no great impression; and yet they are the most that you can do in pure contrast.",

      "Passage": "As formal organizations, business corporations are distinguished by their particular goals, which include maximization of profits, growth, and survival. Providing goods and services is a means to this end. The following statement from the board of directors of the 3M Company is exemplary in this regard: 'The objective of the 3M Company is to produce quality goods and services that are useful and needed by the public, acceptable to the public, and in the best interests of the global economy—and thereby to earn a profit which is essential to the perpetuation of the useful role of the company.'\n\nThese goals provide the raison d’etre and ultimate ethical values of the 3M Company. If, for example, a number of individuals (outsiders or even insiders) believe that a company’s aggressive marketing of infant formula in third world countries is morally wrong, the company is unlikely to be moved by arguments based on ethos alone as long as what it is doing remains profitable. But if those opposed to the company’s practice organize a highly effective boycott of the company’s products, their moral views will soon enter into the company’s deliberations indirectly as limiting operating conditions. They can, at this point, no more be ignored than a prohibitive increase in the costs of certain raw materials.\n\nAlthough the concepts and categories of ethics may be applied to the conduct of corporations, there are important differences between the values and principles underlying corporate behavior and those underlying the actions of most individuals. As individuals, we are often concerned with integrity, autonomy, and responsibility even when they cannot be shown to further a basic goal such as overall happiness; we regard them as important and valuable in themselves and not simply as a means to some other more basic end.\n\nIf corporations are by their nature end- or goal-directed how can they acknowledge acts as wrong in and of themselves? Is it possible to hold one criminally responsible for acts that if performed by a human person would result in criminal liability?\n\nThe first case of this type to achieve widespread public attention was the attempt to prosecute the Ford Motor Company for manslaughter as the result of alleged negligent or reckless decision making concerning the safety engineering of the Pinto vehicle. Although the defendant corporation and its officers were found innocent after trial, the case can serve as an exemplar for our purposes.\n\nIn essence, the prosecution in this case attempted to show that the corporation had produced and distributed a vehicle that was known to be defective at the time of production and sale, and that even after a great deal of additional information accumulated regarding the nature of the problems, the corporation took no action to correct them. The obvious noncorporate analogy would be the prosecution of a person who was driving a car with brakes known to be faulty, who does not have them repaired because it would cost too much, and who kills someone when the brakes eventually fail and the car does not stop in time. Such cases involving individuals are prosecuted and won regularly.\n\nIf corporations have no concept of right or wrong because they are exclusively goal-directed, can they be convicted in cases of this type, and what purpose would be served by such a conviction? Perhaps we can make a utilitarian argument for convicting corporations of such crimes. The argument would be that of deterrence; conviction and punishment would deter other corporations from taking similar actions under similar circumstances. However, there appears to be considerable evidence that deterrence does not work on corporations, even if, arguably, it works on individuals. The possibility of being discovered and the potential magnitude of the fine merely become more data to be included in the analysis of limiting conditions.",

      "Passage": "Few ideas are more deeply entrenched in our political culture than that of impending ecological doom. Beginning in 1962, when Rachel Carson warned that pollution was a threat to all human and animal life on the planet, pessimistic appraisals of the health of the environment have been issued with increasing urgency.\n\nAnd yet, thanks in large part to her warnings, a powerful political movement was born and a series of landmark environmental bills became law. These laws and their equivalents in Western Europe, along with a vast array of private efforts spurred by environmental consciousness that Carson helped raise, have been a stunning success in both the United States and Europe where environmental trends are, for the most part, positive; and environmental regulations, far from being burdensome and expensive, have proved to be strikingly effective, have cost less than was anticipated, and have made the economies of the countries that have put them into effect stronger, not weaker. In recent years, several worrisome environmental trends have either declined from their peak or ended altogether. The amount of household trash dumped in landfills, for example, has been diminishing since the late nineteen eighties, when recycling began to take hold.\n\nRecycling, which was a fringe idea a decade ago, is now a major growth industry, and is converting more than twenty per cent of America’s municipal wastes into useful products. Despite start-up problems, many municipal recycling programs now pay for themselves. Emissions of chlorofluorocarbons, which deplete the ozone layer, have been declining since 1987. Studies now suggest that ozone-layer replenishment may begin within a decade. Dozens of American cities once dumped raw sludge into the ocean. This category of pollution passed into history in 1992, when the final load of New York City sludge slithered off a barge imaginatively named Spring Brook. Today, instead of being dumped into the ocean, municipal sludge is either disposed of in regulated landfills or, increasingly, put to good use as fertilizer.\n\nAmerica’s record of protecting species threatened with extinction, which is often depicted as dismal, is in truth enviable. Since 1973, when the Endangered Species Act took effect, seven animal species in North America have disappeared. Several hundred others once considered certain to die out continue to exist in the wild. A number of species, including the bald eagle and the Arctic peregrine falcon have been or are being taken off the priority-protection list.\n\nIt’s true, of course, that some environmental programs are muddled. For instance, the Endangered Species Act can have the unfair effect of penalizing landholders who discover rare creatures on their property, by prohibiting use of the land. In the main, though, conservation has been an excellent investment. Environmental initiatives worked well even in their early years, when they were driven by top-heavy federal edicts. They work even better as new regulations have centered on market mechanisms and voluntary choice; new acid-rain reductions, for example, are being achieved at unexpectedly affordable rates, thanks to a free-market program under which companies trade pollution “allowances” with each other. Western market economies excel at producing what they are asked to produce, and, increasingly, the market is being asked to produce conservation.\n\nConsider some of what has been accomplished in this country. Thanks to legislation, technical advances, and lawsuits that have forced polluters to pay liability costs, America’s air and water are getting cleaner, forests are expanding, and many other environmental indicators are on the upswing.\n\nNevertheless, the vocabulary of environmentalism has continued to be dominated by images of futility, crisis, and decline. Nor are environmentalists the only people reluctant to acknowledge the good news; advocates at both ends of the political spectrum, each side for its reasons, seem to have tacitly agreed to play it down. The left is afraid of the environmental good news because it undercuts stylish pessimism; the right is afraid of the good news because it shows that governmental regulations might occasionally amount to something other than wickedness incarnate, and actually produce benefits at an affordable cost.",

      "Passage": "While most archeologists believe that primitive European societies were patriarchal in both their social and religious structures, a new controversial theory challenges these traditional views. This theory suggests that during the Stone Age there thrived in and around Europe peace-loving, matriarchal communities in which men and women lived together as equals, respected nature, and worshipped a nurturing deity called the Great Goddess.\n\nThe people of “Old Europe”—Europe from 7000 B.C. to 3500 B.C.—lived in stable agricultural societies in which women headed clans and men labored as hunters and builders, but neither sex acted as a dominant force with respect to the other. War was shunned and craftspeople created comfortable dwellings and graceful ceramics instead of weapons. Like the woman-centered social system, the religion of Stone Age Europe focused on women in its veneration of the life-generating Great Goddess and other female deities. Worship was closely linked to the themes of respect for life and regeneration.\n\nProponents of this theory contend that this peaceful and harmonious society was shattered by waves of Indo-European invaders in about the year 3500 B.C., when marauders from the Russian steppes transformed Europe from a peaceful, agrarian culture to one in which men dominated women and wars raged. Social and sexual egalitarianism were replaced by patriarchy and hierarchy, and warrior gods dethroned the Great Goddess. With the widespread decimation of Old Europe, the goddess-centered religion went underground. However, its symbols have reappeared over the centuries in the forms of the female deities of Greece and Rome, in the Virgin Mary, and in the belief in spiritual forces lurking within the natural world.\n\nThe theory of the Great Goddess has been hailed by feminist social critics, artists, and religious thinkers for providing an important alternative to traditional, patriarchal mythologies and paradigms, as well as for providing a new and more positive model for the human relationship to the natural world.\n\nEminent anthropologist Ashley Montagu calls the theory “a benchmark in the history of civilization,” yet many other investigators into prehistoric Europe consider the theory an unsubstantiated and idealistic version of history. To a number of critics, the chief problem in this radical theory is one of method. Traditional archeologists, taking issue with unorthodox speculation on ancient belief systems, contend that archeological evidence may tell us something about what people ate in the small villages of prehistoric Europe, how they built their homes, and what they traded, but cannot tell us much about what the dwellers of the ancient world actually thought. To them, such speculation is illegitimate. The most severe critics warn that, in blurring the distinction between intuition and fact, proponents of the new theory have failed as scientists.\n\nBut supporters of the theory of a goddess-worshipping Old Europe counter that such critiques reveal a certain narrow-mindedness on the part of scientists rather than weaknesses on the part of their theory arguing that some degree of speculation is important, perhaps even necessary, for the sake of progress in archeology and other fields. This element of speculation helps reveal the implications of a theory.",

      "Passage": "In public Greek life, a man had to make his way at every step through the immediate persuasion of the spoken word. Whether it be addressing an assembly, a law-court or a more restricted body, his oratory would be a public affair rather than under the purview of a quiet committee, without the support of circulated commentary, and with no backcloth of daily reportage to make his own or others’ views familiar to his hearers. The oratory's immediate effect was all-important; it would be naive to expect that mere reasonableness or an inherently good case would equate to a satisfactory appeal. Therefore, it was early realized that persuasion was an art, up to a point teachable, and a variety of specific pedagogy was well established in the second half of the fifth century. When the sophists claimed to teach their pupils how to succeed in public life, rhetoric was a large part of what they meant, though, to do them justice, it was not the whole. The contests of Attic tragedy exhibit all the tricks of this trade, as well as the art of the poets; and the private life of the Greeks was lived so much in public that the pervasive rhetorical manner crept in here too.\n\nSkill naturally bred mistrust. If a man of good will had need of expression advanced of mere twaddle, to learn how to expound his contention effectively, the truculent or pugnacious could be taught to dress their case in well-seeming guise. It was a standing charge against the sophists that they ‘made the worse appear the better cause,’ and it was this immoral lesson which the hero of Aristophanes’ Clouds went to learn from, of all people, Socrates. Again, the charge is often made in court that the opponent is an adroit orator and the jury must be circumspect so as not to let him delude them. From the frequency with which this crops up, it is patent that the accusation of cleverness might damage a man. In Greece, juries, of course, were familiar with the style, and would recognize the more evident artifices, but it was worth a litigant’s while to get his speech written for him by an expert. Persuasive oratory was certainly one of the pressures that would be effective in an Athenian law-court.\n\nA more insidious danger was the inevitable desire to display this art as an art. It is not easy to define the point at which a legitimate concern with style shades off into preoccupation with manner at the expense of matter, but it is easy to perceive that many Greek writers of the fourth and later centuries passed that danger point. The most influential was Isocrates, who polished for long years his pamphlets, written in the form of speeches, and taught to many pupils the smooth and easy periods he had perfected. This was a style of only limited use in the abrupt vicissitudes of politics. Isocrates took to the written word in compensation for his inadequacy in live oratory; the tough and nervous tones of a Demosthenes were far removed from his, though they, too, were based on study and practice. The exaltation of virtuosity did palpable harm. This was not due mainly to the influence of Isocrates: public display was normal and inevitable for a world which talked and listened far more than it read. The balance was always delicate, between style as a vehicle and style as an end in itself.\n\nWe must not try to pinpoint a specific moment when it, once and for all, tipped over; but certainly, as time went on, virtuosity weighed heavier. While Greek freedom lasted, and it mattered what course of action a Greek city decided to take, rhetoric was a necessary preparation for public life, whatever its side effects. When the study became, in the gloomiest sense of the word, academic, only the side effects remained, and they were not such as to encourage depth of thought. It had been a source of strength for Greek civilization that its problems, of all kinds, were thrashed out very much in public. The shallowness which the study of rhetoric might (not must) encourage was the corresponding weakness.",

      "Passage": "Those who opine lose their impunity when the circumstances in which they pontificate are such that generate from their expression a positive instigation of some mischievous act. An opinion that corn dealers are starvers of the poor, or that owning private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard. Acts, of whatever kind, which without justifiable cause do harm to others, may be, and in the more important cases are absolutely required to be, controlled by the unfavorable sentiments, and, when needful, by the active interference of mankind. The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people. But if he refrains from molesting others in matters that concern them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in matters which concern himself he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so it is that there should be different experiments of living, that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others, and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when anyone thinks fit to try them. Where not the person’s own character but the traditions and customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of individual and social progress.\n\nIt would be absurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever had been known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had as yet done nothing toward showing that one mode of existence, or of conduct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that people should be so taught and trained in youth as to know and benefit by the ascertained results of human experience. But it is the privilege and proper condition of a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to use and interpret experience in his own way. It is for him to find out what part of recorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstances and character. The traditions and customs of other people are, to a certain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught them—presumptive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference—but, in the first place, their experience may be too narrow, or they may have not interpreted it rightly. Secondly, their interpretation of experience may be correct, but unsuited to him. Customs are made for customary circumstances and customary characters, and his circumstances or his character may be uncustomary. Thirdly, though the customs be both good as customs and suitable to him, yet to conform to custom merely as custom does not educate him or develop in him any of the qualities which are the distinctive endowments of a human being.

      "Passage": "Most diseases or conditions improve by themselves, are self-limiting, or even if fatal, seldom follow a strictly downward spiral. In each case, intervention can appear to be quite efficacious. This becomes all the more patent if you assume the point of view of a knowing practitioner of fraudulent medicine.\n\nTo take advantage of the natural ups and downs of any disease (as well as of any placebo effect), it’s best to begin your treatment when the patient is getting worse. In this way, anything that happens can more easily be attributed to your wonderful and probably expensive intervention. If the patient improves, you take credit; if he remains stable, your treatment stopped his downward course. On the other hand, if the patient worsens, the dosage or intensity of the treatment was not great enough; if he dies, he delayed too long in coming to you.\n\nIn any case, the few instances in which your intervention is successful will likely be remembered (not so few, if the disease in question is self-limiting), while the vast majority of failures will be forgotten and buried. Chance provides more than enough variation to account for the sprinkling of successes that will occur with almost any treatment; indeed, it would be a miracle if there weren’t any “miracle cures.”\n\nEven in outlandish cases, it’s often difficult to refute conclusively some proposed cure or procedure. Consider a diet doctor who directs his patients to consume two whole pizzas, four birch beers, and two pieces of cheesecake for every breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and an entire box of fig bars with a quart of milk for a bedtime snack, claiming that other people have lost six pounds a week on such a regimen. When several patients follow his instructions for three weeks, they find they’ve gained about seven pounds each. Have the doctor’s claims been refuted?\n\nNot necessarily, since he might respond that a whole host of auxiliary understandings weren’t met: the pizzas had too much sauce, or the dieters slept sixteen hours a day, or the birch beer wasn’t the right brand. Number and probability do, however, provide the basis for statistics, which, together with logic, constitutes the foundation of the scientific method, which will eventually sort matters out if anything can. However, just as the existence of pink does not undermine the distinction between red and white, and dawn doesn’t indicate that day and night are really the same, this problematic fringe area doesn’t negate the fundamental differences between science and its impostors.\n\nThe philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine ventures even further and maintains that experience never forces one to reject any particular belief. He views science as an integrated web of interconnecting hypotheses, procedures, and formalisms, and argues that any impact of the world on the web can be distributed in many different ways. If we’re willing to make drastic enough changes in the rest of the web of our beliefs, the argument goes, we can hold to our belief in the efficacy of the above diet, or indeed in the validity of any pseudoscience.",

      "Passage": "In the decades following World War II, American business had undisputed control of the world economy, producing goods of such high quality and low cost that foreign corporations were unable to compete. But in the mid-1960s the United States began to lose its advantage and by the 1980s American corporations lagged behind the competition in many industries. In the computer chip industry, for example, American corporations had lost most of both domestic and foreign markets by the early 1980s.\n\nThe first analysts to examine the decline of American business blamed the U.S. government. They argued that stringent governmental restrictions on the behavior of American corporations, combined with the wholehearted support given to foreign firms by their governments, created and environment in which American products could not compete. Later analysts blamed predatory corporate raiders who bought corporations, not to make them more competitive in the face of foreign competition, but rather to sell off the most lucrative divisions for huge profits.\n\nStill later analysts blamed the American workforce, citing labor demands and poor productivity as the reasons American corporations have been unable to compete with Japanese and European firms. Finally, a few analysts even censured American consumers for their unpatriotic purchases of foreign goods. The blame actually lies with corporate management, which has made serious errors based on misconceptions about what it takes to be successful in the marketplace. These missteps involve labor costs, production choices, and growth strategies.\n\nEven though labor costs typically account for less than 15% of a product’s total cost, management has been quick to blame the costs of workers’ wages for driving up prices, making American goods uncompetitive. As a result of attempts to minimize the cost of wages, American corporations have had trouble recruiting and retaining skilled workers.\n\nThe emphasis on cost minimization has also led to another blunder: an over-concentration on high technology products. Many foreign firms began by specializing in the mass production and sale of low technology products, gaining valuable experience and earning tremendous profits. Later, these corporations were able to break into high technology markets without much trouble; they simply applied their previous manufacturing experience and ample financial resources to the production of higher quality goods. American business has consistently ignored this very sensible approach.\n\nThe recent rash of corporate mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. has not helped the situation either. While American firms have neglected long-range planning and production, preferring instead to reap fast profits through mergers and acquisitions, foreign firms have been quick to exploit opportunities to ensure their domination over future markets by investing in the streamlining and modernization of their facilities.",

      "Passage": "The woman-suffrage campaign was indeed as much evangelism—a kind of social gospel—as it was politics. The copious documentation left behind in the wake of the suffragist movement recounts a story of missionary zeal, untiring political tuition, and a commitment to the conception of America as an experiment in civic justice. Underpinning this ideology were strands of American exceptionalism laced with occasional self-righteousness and appeals to female moral superiority revealing suffragists as having an eclectic social philosophy oscillating between the poles of preaching women’s superior virtues and proclaiming their essential humanity.\n\nLeading suffragists exploited political rhetoric, effectively turning the great American narratives, biblical and civic, stories of new beginnings, brave struggles, repentance and renewal, to their own purposes. Southern suffragists often coupled panegyrics to woman’s purity with appeals to racial and ethnic prejudices. One leader argued openly in 1903 that “enfranchisement of women would insure immediate and durable white supremacy.”\n\nEducated adults of the day—and the suffragists were overwhelmingly drawn from the ranks of the educated—knew their Bunyan, understood that overcoming adversity was a test of character, and even believed that overcoming adversity was the way character was formed. Above all, suffragists saw in the vote a great engine for social change, a way to tap woman’s greater capacity for human empathy, her status as “the mother of the race.” Women, they believed, would vote en bloc, for the good of humanity, and the world would look different forever. Some argued that if the moral power of women could be utilized through the ballot, human suffering would be alleviated; social wrongs would be righted; a new democratic age would begin.\n\nNo consensus has been reached on the dimensions of the gender gap, its importance or its potential for affecting the outcome of elections or public policy more generally. Our attention should be focused not so much on whether women will vote or govern differently from men, but rather on why suffrage is so vital to a democratic society. Suffrage is to the individual what sovereignty is to states. Civic emancipation, of which the franchise is the indispensable feature, is the only sure and certain basis for democratic political life even if it cannot accomplish every good end.\n\nEven more moderate suffragists believed that American women who know history “will always resent the fact that American men chose to enfranchise Negroes fresh from slavery before enfranchising American wives and mothers, and allowed hordes of European immigrants totally unfamiliar with the traditions and ideals of American government to be enfranchised and thus qualified to pass upon the question of the enfranchisement of American women.” Suffragists sought to capitalize on this anti-immigrant, anti-black sentiment in order to promote their own ends—a story that has been told, and lamented, by later generations of feminists and historians.",

      "Passage": "The recent centennial of the founding of the American Historical Association has given historians a properly historical reason for considering the present state of their discipline. The profession’s introspectionist analysis may be said to have begun a few years ago with the publication of The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States, an upbeat and self-congratulatory volume intended by the sponsoring AHA as a demonstration of “state of the art” historiography. Introducing this volume, editor Michael Kammen stated that after a changing of the guard in the 1970s, the professional historical community is mainly concerned with questions of social history, intergenerational conflict, and human responses to structures of power.\n\nHaving repudiated the basic commitments to nationalism and the ideal of scholarly detachment that had always sustained historical writing in the United States, professional historians found themselves—not surprisingly, one might add—cut off from their cultural environment. That this situation is markedly different from the formative period of historical scholarship can be seen in centennial numbers of the American Historical Review, the most recent expression of the profession’s reflective tendency, which have explored the nature of historical thinking at the time of the association’s founding a century ago.\n\nWhat has been all but ignored in these official efforts at intellectual stocktaking is the enduring body of historical writing produced by American scholars between the end of the founding period in the early twentieth century and the onset of the excitement of the 1970s. Perhaps it is the thoroughness with which scholars have for two decades described the shift from progressive consensus to New Left history that accounts for this neglect. Whatever its reason, however, the oversight is fortunately rectified by the appearance of an “unofficial” volume on American historiography, Twentieth-Century American Historians which describes an approach to history that reminds us that until very recently history faithfully maintained its literary orientation and narrative character. It is a bit astonishing to learn that historians like Douglas Southall Freeman were nationally known figures whose books sold in the hundreds of thousands. It is instructive to recall that several of the most widely read and influential writers of history, such as Allan Nevins, Claude G. Bowers, and James Truslow Adams, possessed no formal historical training. And it is heartening to read of a time when, despite its academic institutional setting, cultural alienation was not asserted as a sign of intellectual sophistication and certification.\n\nAlthough by no means uncritical, the authors of the essays in Twentieth-Century American Historians have approached their subject with an attitude of respectful admiration for the accomplishments of their intellectual mentors. It is unusual, moreover, to find in contemporary scholarship the open-mindedness to conservative points of view, and immunity to orthodox liberal assumptions, that inform this volume.",

      "Passage": "In a society little dedicated to sustaining relationships, encouraging cooperation and community, recognizing the value of collaboration, or rewarding altruism rather than greed, women have historically defined, defended, and sustained a set of insights, values, and activities which, if never dominant, at least provided a counterweight and an alternative ideal to the anomie, disconnectedness, fragmentation, and commercialization of our culture.\n\nMany of us saw women’s experiences and concerns as the source of a sorely needed transformative vision—a profound commitment to the emotional and physical activities, attitudes, and ethical comportment that help people grow and develop, that nurture and empower them, affirming their strengths and helping them cope with their weaknesses, vulnerabilities and life crises.\n\nWhen America’s masculine-dominated, marketplace culture has not openly thwarted women’s hopes and dreams, it has often tried to co-opt women’s liberation. Thus, while many women have remained faithful to this vision and still struggle valiantly to make it a reality, it has been difficult for millions of others to resist a barrage of messages from corporate America and the media that define mastery and liberation in competitive, marketplace terms. Corporate America and the media have declared that feminism triumphs when women gain the opportunity to compete in what Abraham Lincoln once called the great “race of life.”\n\nFollowing a classic pattern in which the victims of aggression identify with their aggressors, many prominent advocates within the highly competitive capitalist marketplace have themselves embraced this masculinized corruption. Placing competition above caring, work above love, power above empowerment, and personal wealth above human worth, corporate America has created a late-twentieth-century hybrid—a refashioned feminism that takes traditional American ideas about success and repackages them for the new female contestants in the masculine marketplace.\n\nThis hybrid is equal-opportunity feminism—an ideology that abandons transformation to adaptation, promoting male-female equality without questioning the values that define the very identity it seeks. From the equal-opportunity feminism first envisaged in The Feminine Mystique to that promoted today by Working Woman and Savvy magazines, and the dozens of primers that promote the dress-for-success philosophy that often pretends to speak for all of feminism, progress and liberation have been defined in male, market terms. While some equal-opportunity feminists pay lip service to the work of their more care-oriented sisters, claiming that they would support a broad agenda that addresses our caring needs, the overarching mission of many is to help women adapt to the realities of the masculine marketplace. In this environment, the goal of liberation is to be treated as a man’s equal in a man’s world. We had hoped that by going into the marketplace and taking our posts there as individuals, we would somehow subvert it.\n\nIt is, of course, true that a great many professional women are deeply concerned about the fate of personal, political and social life in modern America. They express great disenchantment but nonetheless seem caught in a gilded cage.\n\nMany believed that our femininity would protect us, that the force of our feminism would make us invulnerable to the seductive logic of either patriarchy or capitalism. What we had not counted on was the ability of the marketplace to seduce and beguile the best and the brightest, its capacity to entrap us in its rules and entangle us in its imperatives. A few women have won great wealth and privilege. But, not unlike men in similar positions, many of them are unwilling to jeopardize what they’ve acquired in order to work for change. Some are so caught up in their own personal sagas that they have forgotten the women who have been left behind.",

      "Passage": "The temperate conifer forests flanking the Cascade Mountains of the Pacific Northwest are a product of the regional climate. Frequent rain and fog encourage the growth of lush vegetation in a part of the world where cool Pacific storms march relentlessly shoreward from the north and west.\n\nA million years from now, a geoscientist examining the fossils and sediments of the rocks that are currently being formed in this region will be able to say confidently that the climate had been moist and cool. Unless, that is, that scientist happened to be looking at rocks formed near Mount St. Helens or another of the active volcanoes in the range. Looking at these rocks, the scientist might think that the Pacific Northwest was a savannah or even a desert. According to Judith Harris of the University of Colorado Museum and John Van Couvering of the American Museum of Natural History, volcanically influenced ecosystems may look, in retrospect, as if they developed in a much drier regional climate than actually existed.\n\nThey named the phenomenon “mock aridity.” Their idea may explain why computer models tend to predict wetter climates than those suggested by the fossils. And it may mean that some paleoecologists will have to reevaluate their evidence. Explains Harris, “Volcanic activity makes for a barren environment.” After an isolated volcanic episode, a pioneering biological community will develop, followed by successional communities and, eventually, a climax community. When an ecosystem has reached climatic climax, it is a steady-state community that reflects the regional climate. But if volcanism is persistent, the biological community will never have the chance to reach climatic climax. It will bounce around between several pioneer and successional stages.\n\nThe possible implications are that some well-established paleoclimate stories might have to be rewritten. The two most significant examples are equatorial East Africa from the Miocene epoch (about 23 million years ago) to the present and the North American Great Plains from the Oligocene epoch (about 38 million years ago) to the present. Both have been interpreted as having woodland or savannah mosaic ecologies throughout each period. A savannah mosaic may consist of woodlands, treed grasslands and grasslands. Both areas, however, experienced persistent volcanism throughout each period. Had there been no volcanic activity, both regions might have appeared wetter. There might have been deciduous forests in North America and deciduous rain forests in East Africa.\n\nA test of this idea, asserts paleoanthropologist Richard Potts, is to look at the global climate record in places where volcanism is not a factor. In the oceans, global temperature fluctuations are recorded in the oxygen-isotope ratios of marine sediments. These records are relatively immune to the local effects of terrestrial volcanism. “There you see the climatic change occurring later than what people have been seeing on land,” says Potts. This is consistent with Harris’s suggestions about the regional climates of the North American Great Plains and equatorial East Africa. However, Potts says, the change is not steady and, in fact, fluctuations in the global climate have increased over the past 50 million years.\n\nThe ecosystems in these two examples developed during the transition from globally warm and wet climates of the Cretaceous period, which ended about 65 million years ago, to the climatically fluctuating ice ages of the past few million years. A big question among paleoecologists, particularly those who study human evolution, has been, when did the climate become cool and dry enough for forests to give way to savannah environments?",

      "Passage": "The recurring theme of equality in the United States has flared into a fervent moral issue at crucial stages: the Revolutionary and Jacksonian periods, the Civil War, the populist and progressive eras, the New Deal, and the 1960s and 1980s. The legitimacy of American society is challenged by some set of people unhappy with the degree of equality. New claims are laid, new understandings are reached, and new policies for political or economic equality are instituted. Yet the equality issue endures outside these moments of fervor. Ideologies in favor of extending equality are arrayed against others that would limit its scope; advocates of social justice confront defenders of liberty.\n\nIn the moments of egalitarian ascendancy, libertarians are on the defensive. In the moments of retrenchment, egalitarians cling to previous gains. And in either period the enemy is likely to be the “special interests” that have too much power. In egalitarian times, these are the moneyed interests. In times of retrenchment, these are labor or big government and its beneficiaries.\n\nThe moments of creedal passion, in Samuel Huntington’s words, have usually been outbursts of egalitarianism. In part, the passion springs from the self-interest of those who would benefit from a more equal distribution of goods or political influence. But the passion also springs from ideology and values, including deep religious justifications for equality.\n\nThe passion accompanying the discovery or rediscovery that ideals do not match reality is particularly intense when the ideal is as deeply felt as is equality. Yet there can be passion on the nonegalitarian side as well. The self-interested passion to protect an established position may be even more powerful than the passion to redress inequality, though its expression may be more muted.\n\nDevotion to inequality may also be based on ideals, such as liberty, individualism, and the free market, which are no less ancient and venerable. Like the ideals of equality, these alternative ideals serve as yardsticks for measuring whether society has moved away from its true principles.\n\nYet the spirit of reform during Reconstruction dissipated in the face of spent political struggles, sluggish social institutions, and outright mendacity. Society’s entrepreneurial energy was channeled into economic activity, and the courts failed to endorse many of the reformers’ grandest visions. The egalitarian thrust of the Populists around the turn of the century inspired an anti-egalitarian counterthrust over the next two decades.\n\nAmericans do not have an ideology that assigns clear priority to one value over any other. At every historical juncture where equality was an issue, its proponents failed to do all that they had set out to do. Swings in the equality of social conditions are restrained not just by institutional obstacles but by fundamental conflicts of values that are a traditional element of American politics. Faith in the individualistic work ethic and belief in the legitimacy of unequal wealth retard progression to the egalitarian left. As for conservatism, the indelible tenet of political equality firmly restrains the right and confirms a commitment to the disadvantaged. In seeking equal opportunity over equal result, Americans forego a ceiling, not a floor.",

      "Passage": "The last ice age has left its telltales written quite clearly across the landscape. When Louis Agassiz first promulgated his theory that ice had once covered the Swiss countryside, he looked to the valleys there that retain glaciers to this day. Like other observers, he noted the presence of strange boulders, called “erratics,” tossed down in valleys like flotsam after a flood had drained away. He saw the strange polish along the bedrock—a sheen imparted as if by some massive swipe of sandpaper; he saw the debris of rocks and boulders fringing the margin of existing glaciers. He saw what can be seen still, markings in stone that indicated that ice once flowed over vast stretches of land now clear and verdant.\n\nThe first great glaciations must have scored the earth as deeply in their turn, and, in principle, we ought to be able to track the history of the early ice ages by following the same reasoning Agassiz used to persuade himself and his contemporaries that ice once covered the earth. But the marks left by these earlier glaciations are quite subtle, tracks turned ghostly with great age. There are, however, telltale deposits of ancient rocks that strongly suggest that they had been ground together and laid down by the spread of ice.\n\nThe Australian climate historian L.A. Frakes has prospected through various theories proposed to account for those early ice ages. He isn’t terribly enthusiastic about any of the possible culprits, but his choice for the least unlikely of them all emerges out of the recent revival of what was once a radically unorthodox idea: that continents drift over the face of the planet. Frakes argues that the glaciers originated at sites near the poles and that the ice ages began because the continents of the early earth had drifted to positions that took more and more of their land nearer to the polar regions.\n\nMore land near the poles meant that more precipitation fell as snow and could be compacted on land to form glaciers. With enough glaciers, the increase in the amount of sunlight reflected back into space off the glistening white sheen of the ice effectively reduced the amount by which the sun warmed the earth, creating the feedback loop by which the growth of glaciers encouraged the growth of more glaciers. Rocks have been found in North America, Africa and Australia whose ages appear to hover around the 2.3 billion-year-old mark. That date and their spread are vague enough, however, to make it almost impossible to determine just how much of the earth was icebound during the possible range of time in which each of the glacial deposits was formed.\n\nUncertainties about both the timing and the extent of these glaciers also muddy the search for the cause of the ancient ice ages. The record is so spotty that geologists are not sure whether areas near the equator or nearer the poles were the coolest places on earth. It’s also possible that volcanic eruptions had tossed enough dust into the atmosphere to screen out sunlight and cool the earth. While some of the glacial records in the rocks do indeed contain evidence of volcanic activity prior to the buildup of glacial debris, others do not.\n\nSuch traces are the currency of science—data—and like money, a richness of data both buys you some credibility and ties you down, eliminating at least some theoretically plausible explanations. For this early period, theorists have come up with a variety of ideas to explain the ancient ice ages, all elegant and mostly immune to both proof and criticism. For example, a change in the earth’s orbit could have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching the planet. However, the only physical signature of such an event that would show in the rocks would be the marks of the glaciers themselves.",

      "Passage": "Psychology has reflected and contributed to the cultural bias of exalting motherhood at the expense of fatherhood. Sigmund Freud considered the mother, but not the father, to have a prominent role in infant development. Gadpaille argues that maternalism is instinctual to females, not only in the species but in mammals generally. He warns that anyone advocating “male mothering may bring harm to everyone concerned.” Strongly influenced by such psychological theory, our culture has been taken in by the “superiority of mother” theory.\n\nBenjamin Spock, in a six-hundred-page book on child care, devotes just three pages to the role of fathers. While he admits that a man does not sacrifice his masculinity, Spock thinks child care is something the father should do only occasionally—just to help the mother out. Fathers who win custody of children in divorce proceedings are often advised that they should immediately hire full-time housekeepers to function as surrogate mothers.\n\nBut, alas, mothers who win custody are not told to provide surrogate fathers for them. Margaret Mead, the famous anthropologist, once remarked that “fathers are a biological necessity but a social accident.” Throughout the nineteenth and much of the twentieth century, our culture has been quite comfortable with this stereotypical view of fathers. “Less than ten percent of the scientific studies of parents have taken the father’s role into account, in spite of the fact that half of all parents are fathers.” Society has not yet changed in any major ways with regard to fathers as nonparents. However, researchers have finally realized that “the motherhood role is not an inherited behavior pattern, but a learned set of social skills.”\n\nFemale children begin learning these social skills at a very early age; society makes no effort to see that boys learn these same social skills. Theories of “maternal instinct” and attachment or bonding as being exclusively maternal are now being called into question. Infants bond with both the mother and the father. A growing body of literature now reveals that fathers do have potential nurturance just as mothers do. Men are increasingly demanding to be accepted as nurturant parents rather than just the provider and protector.\n\nYoung men are beginning to reject the models of parenting provided by their fathers and are searching for ways to become parents as well as fathers. A radical restructuring of maleness and fatherhood is currently under way. Fathering and mothering are two distinct parental roles. When a male is nurturant, he is fathering, not mothering. Both mothering and fathering are valid roles, but they are by no means identical.",

      "Passage": "As opera becomes more popular in America the scarcity of theaters and the unconscionably costly logistics of the lyric stage make it difficult to meet the demand. Many a good-sized and well-to-do community would be able to operate and maintain a modest but live opera theater, but are unwilling to do so because it would unfavorably compare with the splendors of New York’s Metropolitan Opera.\n\nIt is not realized that the rich operatic culture of Italy and Germany is mainly due to their many small municipal theaters which alternate repertory theater with opera. These circumstances have led to concert or “semi-staged” performances which, formerly an exception, now occupy entire companies expressly formed for this purpose. However, stage music, real operatic music, often fails to exert its full power in the frozen formality of the concert platform. In a true opera the particular charm and power of the music does not come through without staging and acting, for gesture is an expression of feeling, and the decor and costumes summarize the external aspects, providing a vision of the whole action. Both are to a considerable degree determined by the music, but they also complement it.\n\nAn opera is a play in music. If it is presented in concert version, then it should not offer a half-hearted gesture towards the theater. Indeed, the “partly staged” performances are even more unsatisfactory than the concert variety. The tenor is all excited, but you do not know why; the soprano is obviously dying, but she remains on her feet. Nor does the stationary chorus, its members turning the pages of their scores without looking at the person they sing about, contribute to the illusion.\n\nDifferent aesthetic laws of governance apply to concert music and theatrical music, for they are incongruous worlds calling for an entirely different sort of imagination from both performers and audience. Opera is theater, the most involved, elaborate, and exciting form of theater. The Italian term “opera” is far more inclusive than its English interpretation, for it embraces not only the musical score but the whole theater, “the work.”\n\nWithout the stage, paucity of musical ideas immediately becomes evident, often painfully so. Take for instance Richard Strauss, some of whose late operas are being performed in concerts. Strauss was a composer who knew every facet of the lyric stage as few have known it, yet what can be quite pleasant on the stage, even if it is not particularly inventive, appears bare and contrived when removed from its natural habitat.\n\nSome may say that the end justifies the means. I can see merit in the concert performance of an opera which otherwise could not hope to be heard, or of one deficient in true theatrical qualities yet of genuine musical value. But neither Strauss, nor Bellini, nor Donizetti qualifies for such a role. Even if we forget the vital function of staging, it is practically impossible, for purely musical reasons, to present such a work on the concert platform. The large orchestra belongs in the pit; when placed on the stage, together with the singers, it makes their position almost untenable, even when led by an experienced opera conductor.",

These conclusion come from psychologists who have developed a test for measuring the likes and dislikes created in the moment of perceiving a word, sound or picture. The findings, if confirmed, have possibly unsettling implications for people’s ability to think and behave objectively. This is all part of preconscious processing, the mind’s perception and organization of information that goes on before it reaches awareness—these judgments are lightning fast in the first moment of contact between the world and the mind.\n\nSome scientists disagree with the claim that virtually every perception carries with it an automatic judgment, though they, too, find that such evaluations are made in many circumstances. These scientists believe that people don’t have automatic attitudes for everything, but rather, for areas of interest.\n\nIn responding to a stimulus, a signal most likely travels first to the verbal cortex, then to the amygdala, where the effect is added, and then back. The circuitry involved can do all this in a matter of a hundred milliseconds or so, long before there is conscious awareness of the word. This creates an initial predisposition that gets things off on a positive or negative footing. These reactions have the power to largely determine the course of a social interaction by defining the psychological reality of the situation from the start.\n\nThe “quick-and-dirty” judgment tends to be more predictive of how people actually behave than is their conscious reflection on the topic. This may represent a new, more subtle tool for research on people’s attitudes, allowing scientists to assess what people feel without their having any idea of what exactly is being tested. You could detect socially sensitive attitudes people are reluctant to admit, like ethnic biases because these automatic judgments occur outside a person’s awareness, as part of an initial perception. They are trusted in the same way senses are trusted, not realizing that seemingly neutral first perceptions are already biased.\n\nConclusions from both camps are based on a method that allows them to detect subtle evaluations made within the first 250 milliseconds—a quarter of a second—of perception of words. The measurement of liking can be made outside the person’s awareness because if the first word is presented in less than a quarter of a second the reaction to it never registers in consciousness, though it can still be read.",

      "Passage": "Tribal immunity is the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied on behalf of Native American tribes. Under the Indian Commerce Clause, Congress has “plenary” authority over the tribes. Courts have held that these tribes cannot be sued without the consent of Congress. The doctrine of tribal immunity, however, is a judicially created doctrine that the federal courts have independently fashioned.\n\nAt least one Supreme Court Justice has noted the necessity of a more principled analysis of the doctrine of tribal immunity, expressing 'doubts about the continuing vitality in this day of the doctrine of tribal immunity as it was enunciated in the case of the United States v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co.” and “the view that that doctrine may well merit re-examination in an appropriate case.'\n\nThe doctrine first emerged in the case of the United States v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co., where the Supreme Court held 'Indian nations exempt from suit without congressional authorization.' The Supreme Court suggested two grounds for the doctrine. First, Native American tribes enjoy immunity as a result of being recognized as sovereigns.\n\nWithin the last decade, the court has reaffirmed this position, holding that these tribes retain all sovereign powers except those 'expressly terminated by Congress” and “inconsistent with their status.” These powers “are not, in general, delegated powers granted by express acts of Congress', but rather “inherent powers of a limited sovereignty which has never been extinguished.” A second basis for tribal immunity stems from the desire to protect tribal resources.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court did not explicitly pronounce the protection of tribal resources as a ground for its decision, it cited cases in support of its ruling that were primarily concerned with such protection. Unlike the immunities enjoyed by states, the federal government and foreign countries, no limitations have been placed on the scope of tribal immunity. Courts continue to apply the doctrine uncritically in a wide variety of cases, sometimes acknowledging that, had the defendant “been a state or municipal government, the federal government or a foreign nation, it would have been amenable to suit in either state or federal courts.”\n\nFor instance, courts consistently hold that a Native American tribe’s immunity can be waived only by its express consent or the consent of Congress. In contrast to other governments, implied waivers are generally not recognized even in cases where commercial activity by a tribe on or off its reservation has taken place. Similarly, the purchase of insurance by a tribe does not serve to waive immunity. Tribal immunity is, therefore, broader in this respect than is the immunity possessed by states, the federal government, and foreign countries.\n\nThe proprietary acts of Native American tribes have not been distinguished from the governmental functions of tribes, although this distinction has been made in cases concerning other sovereigns. In fact, some courts have specifically upheld that “the fact that a tribe was engaged in an enterprise private or commercial in character, rather than governmental, is not material.” Thus courts continue to find a broader immunity for Native American tribes than is still recognized for any other sovereign.",

      "Passage": "Every four years voters across the United States elect a president. Various factors such as choices in campaign locations, the candidates’ adherence to polling data and use of the Internet by candidates to reach potential voters all influence the preference of those voters, but perhaps none of these is so persuasive as a candidate’s performance on nationally televised debates just prior to the election. Newspapers and television news programs generally attempt to provide thorough coverage of the debates, further augmenting the effect of good or bad candidate performances.\n\nIn this way, the news media fulfill the traditional role of educating the public and enabling voters to make better informed decisions about elected officials. However, the same technology which brings live debates into millions of living rooms across the nation also limits the availability of debate coverage by use of “pool” coverage, the sharing of news coverage with other news organizations. The alternative is unilateral coverage, in which each news organization covers the event independently. Most events subject to pool coverage are so planned by the sponsors because of space limitations or safety concerns for prominent people attending or participating in the events. Since the television media require more people and equipment than their print counterparts, television usually is affected more frequently.\n\nThe pool system, when employed to cover debates between presidential nominees of the major political parties, violates the first amendment. The Constitution’s mandate for a free press allows restrictions on press coverage only when there is a compelling governmental interest at stake. Presidential debates involve no interest sufficient to justify the admission of one news organization to the exclusion of all others.\n\nPool coverage of a presidential debate means that individual broadcasters are unable to cover the event in their own way and, consequently, to convey a unique account to their viewers; they must purchase and use coverage provided by the pool representative or have no coverage at all. The networks participate reluctantly. Pool coverage denies an opportunity to gain maximum insight from the debate. Indeed, the first amendment freedoms afforded the press exist largely to ensure that the public benefits from the free flow of information. The Supreme Court has noted that 'it is the right of viewers and listeners, not the right of the broadcasters, which is paramount.''\n\nTo overcome the problem of restricted access, television news media could be divided into four categories: domestic networks, foreign news services, domestic news services, and independent broadcasters. Some broadcasters would be denied access, but the critical point is that in the end, the viewers will benefit, for they will have seen different debate coverage and, ultimately, will be better informed.",

      "Passage": "One of the most important tasks of ethical analysis is to deliver us from our unrecognized prejudices about right and wrong. For ethicist Paul Taylor perhaps no prejudice is so deeply ingrained as speciesism, the view that members of the human species deserve treatment superior to that accorded members of other species.\n\nIn place of speciesism, Taylor proposes a new theory of environmental ethics based on “the biocentric outlook.” This outlook asserts that humans are equal members of the earth’s community of life and that they and members of other species are interdependent. It further sees all organisms as teleological centers of life in the sense that each is a unique individual pursuing its own best interests by its own means and that 'humans are not inherently superior to other living things.'\n\nTaylor claims that the theory provides the foundation and justification for “respect for nature,” the only moral attitude suitable to have towards earth’s creatures. Respect for nature requires both recognizing that wild plants and animals have inherent worth, and following the moral norm that “living things ought not to be harmed or interfered with in nature.” Taylor claims that human behavior toward nonhumans ought to be guided by the rules of nonmaleficence and noninterference, as well the rule of fidelity and the rule of restitutive justice. These rules prohibit, respectively: harming any entity in the natural environment; restricting the freedom of natural entities or ecosystems so that they cannot exist in a wild state; mistreating any wild animal, as often occurs during hunting or fishing; and failing to make amends when one wrongs a wild plant or animal in any way.\n\nOne problem is with Taylor’s scheme that both accords “inherent worth” to all plants, animals, and humans, and then requires compensation for every intrusion, use, or control (done even for a good reason) affecting any living entity. If everyone has duties of compensation to virtually every other living entity, as indeed we must under Taylor’s scheme, then applying Taylor’s ethics is complex, cumbersome, and unworkable. There is also the problem with the applicability of Taylor’s concepts and duties.\n\nHe claims repeatedly that “all wild living things in the Earth’s natural ecosystems” possess inherent worth. Yet he admits that there are very few wild things in genuinely natural ecosystems—ecosystems wholly free from any human intrusion. This raises at least two problems. First, why does Taylor claim that we have duties only to wild living things in natural ecosystems? If we have only these duties, and if most living things are not wild and not in natural ecosystems, then Taylor may fail to deal with the bulk of problems arising in environmental ethics. Also, if natural ecosystems are those that have experienced no human intrusion or control, then Taylor seems to say that humans are not part of the “natural” world. This contradicts Taylor’s claim that humans are members of earth’s community “in the same sense” as plants and animals.\n\nTaylor does deserve praise because he avoids many of the errors of earlier theorists of environmental ethics. For example, Taylor explicitly rejects Leopold’s highly questionable belief that inanimate objects can be moral subjects; he also disavows an organicist or Gaia view of environmental ethics, as pursued by Leopold, Goodpaster, Lovelock, and others, and shows why organicism errs in giving no place to the good of individual organisms.",

      "Passage": "In Manhattan, the beauty of the night sky is only a faded metaphor, the shopworn verse of an outdated love song. The stars shine no brighter at midnight in midtown than the ones depicted on the time-dimmed ceiling of the waiting room at Grand Central Terminal. The eternal orange glow of the city lights leaves only the faintest hints of the blackness beyond. And when the sky is truly clear and the clouds do not reflect this amber aura, the brightness of the city environs constrict the pupils so much that only the moon can be seen on most evenings. But over the last few weeks it has been possible, even in Manhattan, to watch the evening star—Venus—descending in the west, presenting her orbit, edgewise, to viewers on Earth.\n\nVenus is the luminous body hanging over New Jersey to the west in the early evening. In spite of the fact that it emanates no light of its own—only reflecting light from its neighbor and provider, the sun—it is brighter than any heavenly object visible from Earth except the sun and the moon. For the moment, Venus becomes apparent at twilight, about a third of the way up the western sky, and it sets around 11. Every night people go to bed wondering what strangely bright star that is. To those who live in New York City, it may be the only star they see when trapped on this tiny little island. Whatever the case, in the morning no one remembers that luminous body any longer.\n\nTo say, as one must, that Venus is not a star but a planet seems ungrateful, almost pedantic. Astronomers might have us know that this distinction is not a mere splitting of hairs, but the most basic of divisions, not unlike that of plants and animals. Be that as it may, it is the kind of technicality the English essayist Charles Lamb had in mind when defending the generosity of his personal ignorance almost 200 years ago. “I guess at Venus,” he wrote, “only by her brightness.” Lamb was no Copernican, and neither are most of us. We are little Ptolemies every one. The sun rises and sets upon us. When one lies upon a meadow late at night, etherized by the fullness of the sky, it is all one can do to imagine the simplest of celestial motions—the pivoting of constellations around the North Star. To impart to each point of light the motions that are proper to it—to do the unimaginable calculus of all those interfering rotations, those intersecting gravities—is simply impossible. It is easier to imagine that one is staring at the ceiling of a celestial waiting room, forever spinning around and around above our heads.\n\nBut at the moment, one can almost picture the motion of Venus in its orbit, as if one were looking at a diagram of the solar system. Imagine a line between the sun, at sunset, and Venus, glittering high above the horizon. That, roughly speaking, is the path of the Venusian orbit. When Venus moves toward Earth, as it is doing now, it is the evening star, and when it moves away from Earth, it is the morning star. Even this, to some, might seem like a stretch of the abilities of conceptualization, but it is worth the challenge. For if one can muddle through this mental errand for a moment, it will become clear that a change is about to take place. The moment of transition will occur on June 10, when Venus passes between the sun and Earth. As May wears on, Venus will appear nearer and nearer the sun, until the planet is engulfed by twilight. Venus will come back into view, at dawn, sometime in late July.\n\nFor now, the evening star—Hesperus, as it was anciently known—is a steadily waning crescent, no matter how star-like or globular its light appears. It will not return to its present position until sometime in December 1997. And who knows where we will be by then? Surely someone, but not me, not one of the little Ptolemies, that stares up into the night sky and sees a most beautiful display, arranged every night for his personal enjoyment.",

      "Passage": "In August 1348 the bubonic plague, or Black Death, suddenly appeared in England. Its germs were carried by the fleas on black rats that came into the country on ships from abroad. The first outbreak of the plague was of intense ferocity, for the people had no immunity and persons living close to the margin of subsistence fell victims to the disease.\n\nReturning in 1361, the plague caused high mortality among children born since 1348; there were other visitations in 1368 and 1375. The best estimates place the population of England (exclusive of Wales, Scotland, and Ireland) at about 1.1 million in 1086, about 3.7 million in 1348, about 2.2 million in 1377, and not much more than that in 1450. High farming in the thirteenth century had been based on the scarcity of land, a large population, and a great demand for food—conditions that had forced the peasants to remain on their holdings and to accept the burdens of serfdom. But when the demand for food was less, the profits of agriculture shrank. High farming, which had already been slipping before 1348, came to an end.\n\nThe startling fact about those figures is the amazing drop in population between 1348 and 1377. It may be the number of people in overcrowded England already was beginning to decline before the coming of the Black Death. There were floods and famines in the years between 1315 and 1317. Certainly the plague caused a high mortality. In some monasteries the monks all but disappeared (it is thought that half the clergy in England fell victims to the pestilence). The Black Death had its most striking effect on the rural economy. The balance between the number of laborers and the amount of land under cultivation and the relations between lord and peasant were quickly altered. There were deserted villages and many unoccupied peasant holdings. After the first visitation widows and widowers remarried quickly and produced as many children as before; but because of the high mortality among young people this population increase was not maintained later in the century.\n\nThe work of the manor could not be performed by the villeins who had survived the plague; the lord had to employ casual labor at wages that doubled within a decade. Moreover, a villein, once tied to his holding by economic necessity, could easily run away to another manor where employment would be offered to him with no questions asked.\n\nLandowners complained bitterly of the labor shortage and of the wages they had to pay. In 1351 they obtained the Statute of Laborers, which fixed wages at the rates before the plague, declared that all landless men must accept work when it was offered to them, and prohibited peasants from moving from one manor to another. For a time the statute had some effect, but in the long run it was useless, for wages continued to rise and employers had to pay them. There was also a scarcity of tenants. Few manors were without vacant holdings; hence the yield was less and income from the land declined. Agricultural products no longer fetched high prices. Yet the cost of luxuries and of manufactured goods was rising.\n\nThereafter the plague subsided in the rural areas but remained endemic in London and other towns, where it could become active at any time and could spread along lines of communication into the country. It remained in England for more than 300 years.",

      "Passage": "Physicians have disagreed for years about whether they should be involved in capital punishment of convicted criminals. Some physicians vigorously support participation, often arguing that organs should first be removed for transplantation. One frequent objection to capital punishment is that sometimes techniques don’t work the first time, resulting in lingering, painful deaths. If physicians would guarantee that a patient would not die in such a way, they would gain the trust of some patients.\n\nFor any kind of killing, some physicians favor the creation of “designated killer” technicians. This would free physicians from the taint of killing, keeping their image pure and their hands clean. But is this workable? Insofar as the designated killers are mere technicians, what prevents them from abusing their role? Wouldn’t it be better for physicians, torn between saving life and honoring patients’ wishes, to be reluctant killers? Wouldn’t physicians know best what to do if something went wrong?\n\nMany physicians paradoxically endorse mercy killing but refuse to do it themselves. Nor do they think other physicians should kill. Physicians who support mercy killing but who don’t want physicians to kill commonly emphasize the importance of maintaining the role of the physician as a healer and preserver of life. One poll of American physicians showed 60 percent favoring euthanasia but less than half would perform it themselves. To such physicians, taking life radically conflicts with the symbolic image of physicians. Such conflict, they say, destroys trust in physicians.\n\nDiscussing this problem of designated killers in 1988, New England Journal of Medicine editor Marcia Angell called the idea “an unsavory prospect.” She suggested that mercy killing may one day be the end point of a continuum of good patient care. She asks how any physician can excuse himself from this most basic notion? Dr. Angell concluded, 'Perhaps, also, those who favor legalizing euthanasia but would not perform it should rethink their position.'\n\nDr. Angell implies that it is hypocritical to favor mercy killing but would be unwilling to perform it. Is this true? There are at least two schools of thought. Some thinkers believe that if one favors, say, meat-eating, one should be willing to kill and prepare animals for eating oneself. Others conclude differently, seeing no reason why each person who favors a position must be willing to implement it.\n\nMust you be willing to kill a serial murderer to favor capital punishment? Critics say one must. Being face-to-face with one’s victims creates basic moral qualms and such moral restraints are important to respect. In Stanley Milgram’s studies on obedience, naive subjects under an experimenter’s control were dramatically less willing to inflict injury as the victims became closer to subjects under study. In contrast, as the consequences of actions became more remote, such as by pressing a switch which released a bomb on an unseen, unknown populace, it became easier to inflict injury.",

      "Passage": "DNA degrades quickly after an animal dies, so researchers once believed it impossible to find ancient genetic material. The search for primeval vestiges of DNA took off in the late 1980s after the development of a technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which copies minute quantities of DNA. Armed with PCR, scientists could look for tiny fragments of DNA that might have weathered the millennia unharmed.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have isolated DNA from 20-million-year-old magnolia leaves and extracted DNA from a 135-million-year-old weevil found in amber. Recently, a team extract DNA from bone dating back millions of years for the first time. In the frenzied hunt for ancient DNA, microbiologist Scott R. Woodward may have bagged the biggest quarry. Drawing on lessons learned while growing up among the fossil-rich rocks of eastern Utah, Woodward and his team became the first people to find genetic material belonging to a dinosaur.\n\nWoodward, whose grandfather was a coal miner, knew that mines in the area often contained dinosaur traces. After six months of looking Woodward pulled two bone fragments from a Cretaceous siltstone layer directly atop a coal seam. Impeded by an unstable mine roof, Woodward’s team could not recover any more bone samples. The siltstone apparently inhibited fossilization and preserved much of the original cell structure in the bone. Researchers isolated strands of DNA from both fragments and used PCR to copy a segment that codes for a protein called cytochrome b. Once they had made many copies, they could determine the DNA sequence.\n\nThroughout their work, the biologists took precautions to avoid contaminating the samples with modern DNA or ancient material found within the coal. According to Woodward, circumstantial evidence indicates that the bone fragments belong to one or two species of dinosaurs. Dinosaur tracks are abundant in this coal formation, and the bones visible in the mine were larger than those of a crocodile—the biggest non-dinosaur known in these rocks.\n\nWoodward explains variation found in the DNA as a result of damage to the ancient DNA, which caused the PCR technique to alter the original sequence. Scientists had hoped to use the DNA to resolve debate about the relationship among birds, dinosaurs, and other reptiles. But the cytochrome b fragments were too short to offer meaningful phylogenetic information, says Woodward. Utah’s state paleontologist believes that the fragments found by Woodward could definitely be dinosaur in origin. Other researchers, however, question the identity of the DNA strands. Because the copies of the cytochrome b sequence varied considerably, they wonder whether the DNA comes from several organisms.",

      "Passage": "The following is an exchange between two art historians over the recent restoration of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nScholar A\n\nI shudder to think what Michelangelo’s reaction would be if he were to gaze up today at the famous frescoes he painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel over four centuries ago. He was a practical man and would not have been surprised by the effects of time and environment on his masterpiece. He would have been philosophical about the damage wrought by mineral salts left behind when rainwater leaked through the roof. He would also probably have taken in stride the layers of dirt and soot from the coal braziers that heated the chapel—if that dirt had not been removed during the restoration.\n\nScholar B\n\nThe armament of the restorer is no longer limited to artistic sensibility and historical knowledge. A chemist on the Vatican restoration team identified the composition of the layers swathing Michelangelo’s primary hues. Since there was a stratum of dirt between the painting and the first layer of glaze, it was clear that several decades had elapsed between the completion of the ceiling and the application of the glaze. This justified the use of cleaning solvents that would lift off all but that final layer of dirt, which was kept for the sake of protection of the frescoes.\n\nScholar A\n\nThe Vatican restoration team reveled in inducing a colorful transformation in the frescoes with their special cleaning solvents and computerized analysis equipment. But he would have been appalled at the ravages inflicted on his work by the restorers.\n\nThis effect was not, as they claim, achieved merely by removing the dirt and animal glue (which was, by the way, employed by earlier restorers to revive muted colors). They removed Michelangelo’s final touches as well. The ceiling no longer has its essential quality of suppressed anger and thunderous pessimism. That quality was not an artifact of grime, not a misleading monochrome imposed on the ceiling by time. Michelangelo himself applied a veil of glaze to the frescoes to darken them after he had deemed his work too bright. I think the master would have felt compelled to add a few more layers of glaze had the ceiling radiated forth as it does now. It is clear that the solvents of the restorers did not just strip away the shadows. They also reacted chemically with Michelangelo’s pigments to produce hues the painter himself never beheld.\n\nScholar B\n\nThe particular solvent they employed, AB 57, was chosen because of the overall neutral action of its two chemicals on pigments: one temporarily tones them down, but the other livens them up to the same degree. Thus, the colors that emerged from the shadows are truly what Michelangelo intended to be seen.\n\nThe luminous figures are without doubt the work of a master craftsman who executed typical Renaissance painting techniques to perfection. This is the source of the difficulty you have with the restoration: the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel no longer seems to be the fruit of the wayward genius, defiant of Renaissance fresco-painting protocol, that you always thought Michelangelo was. You don’t like the fact that the painter seems, like a vagabond given a good scrubbing, to be a complete stranger, rational and traditional and devoid of fearfulness and anger. But the veil that led to the misperceptions of Michelangelo has now been lifted, and we may better acquaint ourselves with him.\n\nScholar A\n\nOf course, the restorers left open an avenue for the reversal of their own “lifting of the veil.” Since the layers of animal glue are no longer there to serve as protection, the atmospheric pollutants from the city of Rome now have direct access to the frescoes. In fact, we’ve already noticed significant darkening in some of the restored work, and it’s only been four years since the restoration was completed. It remains to be seen whether the measure introduced to arrest this process—an extensive climate-control system—will itself have any long-term effect on the chapel’s ceiling.",

      "Passage": "Suppose you are about to make a speech attempting to persuade your audience that more spending on education is necessary or that the budget deficit should be reduced through cuts in domestic spending. There are a few different ways you might approach your argument. When it comes down to it, though, you must find a way of presenting your material to your audience that is most effective. What factors make a one-sided argument so effective that they seem to be the tactic of choice for most modern propagandists?\n\nIf a communicator mentions the opposition’s arguments, it might indicate that he or she is an objective, fair-minded person; this could enhance the speaker’s trustworthiness and thus increase his or her effectiveness. On the other hand, if a communicator so much as mentions the arguments of the other side of the issue, it might suggest to the audience that the issue is a controversial one; this could make members of the audience vacillate.\n\nWith these possibilities in mind, it should not come as a surprise that there is no simple relation between one-sided arguments and the effectiveness of the communication. It depends to some extent upon how well informed the audience is and on the audience’s initial opinions on the issue. Citing research contrary to one’s thesis must be a measured risk. If the audience is not already aware of this research, they might be unduly swayed in the wrong direction. Research generally finds that the more well informed the members of the audience are, the less likely they are to be persuaded by a one-sided argument and the more likely they are to be persuaded by an argument that brings out the important opposing arguments and then attempts to refute them. We should underscore that the research does not favor the effectiveness of a simple two-sided argument: It favors the effectiveness of presenting both sides and pointing out the weaknesses in your opponent’s position.\n\nThis makes sense: A well-informed person is more likely to know some of the counterarguments; when the communicator avoids mentioning these, the knowledgeable members of the audience are likely to conclude that the communicator is either unfair or unable to refute such arguments. On the other hand, an uninformed person is less apt to know of the existence of opposing arguments. If the counterargument is ignored, the less well-informed members of the audience are persuaded; if the counterargument is presented, they might get confused.\n\nThe message-dense nature of the mass media often makes it difficult to respond intelligently to what we receive. It takes considerable mental effort to process effectively the stream of one short message after another. Advertisers have observed that consumers frequently find comparative advertising confusing; they mistake one brand for another, leading to a situation in which the advertiser is publicizing the competition. For this reason, comparative advertising is rarely used by the leading brand (why give an upstart free publicity?); it is used mostly by a challenger that might gain from being confused with the leader.\n\nAnother factor influencing the effectiveness of one- versus two-sided persuasion is the partisanship of the audience. As we might expect, if a member of the audience is already predisposed to believe the communicator’s argument, a one-sided presentation has a greater impact on his or her opinion than a two-sided presentation.",

      "Passage": "Self-government is in inverse ratio to numbers. The larger the constituency, the less the value of any particular vote. When he is merely one of millions, the individual elector feels himself to be impotent. The candidates he has voted into office are far away, at the top of the pyramid of power. Theoretically they are the servants of the people; but in fact it is the servants who give orders that the people far off at the base of the great pyramid must obey.\n\nHuman beings act in a great variety of irrational ways, but most of them seem capable, if given a fair chance, of making a reasonable choice in the light of available evidence. Democratic institutions can be made to work only if all concerned do their best to impart knowledge and to encourage rationality. But today, in the world’s most powerful democracy, the politicians and their propagandists prefer to make nonsense of democratic procedures by appealing almost exclusively to the ignorance and irrationality of the electors.\n\nIncreasing population and advancing technology have resulted in an increase in the number and complexity of organizations, an increase in the amount of power concentrated in the hands of officials and a corresponding decrease in the amount of control exercised by the electors, coupled with a decrease in the public’s regard for democratic procedures. Already weakened by the vast impersonal forces at work in the modern world, democratic institutions are now being undermined from within by the politicians and their propagandists. “Both parties,” we were told in 1956 by the editor of a leading business journal, “will merchandize their candidates and issues by the same methods that business has developed to sell goods. These include scientific selection of appeals and planned repetition. Radio spot announcements and ads will repeat phrases with a planned intensity. Billboards will push slogans of proven power. Candidates need, in addition to rich voices and good diction, to be able to look ‘sincerely’ at the TV camera.”\n\nInured to television and radio, the audience is accustomed to being distracted and does not like to be asked to concentrate or to make a prolonged intellectual effort. The great issues of the day must be dealt with in five minutes at the most—and preferably in sixty seconds flat. The political merchandisers appeal only to the weaknesses of voters, never to their potential strength, in no way attempting to educate the masses into becoming fit for self-government. They are content merely to manipulate and exploit them.\n\nFor this purpose all the resources of psychology and the social sciences are mobilized and set to work. Carefully selected samples of the electorate are given “interviews in depth.” These interviews in depth reveal the unconscious fears and wishes most prevalent in a given society at the time of an election. Phrases and images aimed at allaying or, if necessary, enhancing these fears, at satisfying these wishes, at least symbolically, are then chosen by the experts, tried out on readers and audiences, changed or improved in the light of the information thus obtained. After this the political campaign is ready for the mass communicators. All that is now needed is money and a candidate who can be coached to look “sincere.” Under the new dispensation, political principles and plans for specific action have come to lose most of their importance.",

      "Passage": "The planned expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into Eastern Europe has been compared by one sour critic to the behavior of a couple in a crumbling marriage, who instead of going to a marriage counselor decide to try to save their relationship by having a baby, or possibly even several babies. NATO itself is in the middle of a very confused debate about its identity and role, and partly as a result it is difficult to detect any honest, coherent discussion in the West of the necessity for expansion and of how it will affect relations with Russia, the security of the Ukraine and the Baltic States, and the peaceful integration of Ukraine into Europe.\n\nThe official Western line at present is that NATO expansion is meant to “strengthen European security,” but not against Russia or against feared Russian aggression. Nevertheless all public discussion in Poland, and much of it in the United States has been conducted in terms of the need to contain a presumed Russian threat and to prevent Russia from exerting influence on its neighbors—influence that is automatically viewed as illegitimate and threatening to the West.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Russian politicians, including most liberals, now believe it is necessary that most of the former Soviet Union excluding the Baltic States be within a Russian sphere of influence. They see this not as imperialism but as a justifiable defense of Russian interests against a multiplicity of potential threats (radical Islam, future Turkish expansionism), of Russian populations outside Russia, and of areas in which Russia has long maintained a cultural presence—Ukraine, for example.\n\nThis does not necessarily involve demands for hegemony over Russia’s neighbors, but it certainly implies the exclusion of any other bloc’s or superpower’s military presence. In justification Russians point to the Monroe Doctrine and to the French sphere of influence in Africa. Most educated Russians now view Western criticism as mere hypocrisy masking Western aggrandizement.\n\nThe attitude of the entire Russian political establishment to the expansion issue is now strongly and unanimously negative, though the government hopes for the moment to continue exerting influence against expansion by cooperating with NATO—hence its agreement to join the Partnership for Peace. The reasons for Russian opposition are these: NATO expansion is seen as a betrayal of clear though implicit promises made by the West in 1990-91, and a sign that the West regards Russia not as an ally but as a defeated enemy. Russians point out that Moscow agreed to withdraw troops from the former East Germany following unification after NATO promised not to station its troops there.\n\nNow NATO is planning to leapfrog over eastern Germany and end up 500 miles closer to Russia, in Poland. Western arguments that the 1990 promise to Mikhail Gorbachev referred only to East Germany, not to the rest of Eastern Europe, though strictly speaking correct, are not unnaturally viewed by Russians as purely jesuitical.\n\nRussian officials say that the NATO expansion would lead to a reversal of the previous pro-Western policy of the Yeltsin and Gorbachev governments. Also, Russians fear that NATO expansion will ultimately mean the inclusion of the Baltic States and Ukraine within NATO’s sphere of influence, if not in NATO itself—and thus the loss of any Russian influence over these states and the stationing of NATO troops within striking distance of the Russian heartland. The West’s inability publicly to rule out the possible future incorporation of any country in NATO makes it very difficult to assuage Russian fears.",

      "Passage": "Although many may argue with my stress on the continuity of the essential traits of American character and religion, few would question the thesis that our business institutions have reflected the constant emphasis in the American value system on individual achievement. From the earliest comments of foreign travelers down to the present, individuals have identified a strong materialistic bent as a characteristic American trait.\n\nThe worship of the dollar, the desire to make a profit, the effort to get ahead through the accumulation of possessions, all have been credited to the egalitarian character of the society. As Tocqueville noted in his discussion of the consequences of a democracy’s destruction of aristocracy: “They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door to universal competition.”\n\nA study of the comments on American workers of various nineteenth-century foreign travelers reveals that most of these European writers, among whom were a number of socialists, concluded that social and economic democracy in America has an effect contrary to mitigating compensation for social status. American secular and religious values both have facilitated the “triumph of American capitalism,” and fostered status striving.\n\nThe focus on equalitarianism and individual opportunity has also prevented the emergence of class consciousness among the lower classes. The absence of a socialist or labor party, and the historic weakness of American trade-unionism, appear to attest to the strength of values which depreciated a concern with class.\n\nAlthough the American labor movement is similar to others in many respects, it differs from those of other stable democracies in ideology, class solidarity, tactics, organizational structure, and patterns of leadership behavior. American unions are more conservative; they are more narrowly self-interested; their tactics are more militant; they are more decentralized in their collective bargaining; and they have more full-time salaried officials, who are on the whole much more highly paid. American unions have also organized a smaller proportion of the labor force than have unions in these other nations.\n\nThe growth of a large trade-union movement during the 1930s, together with the greater political involvement of labor organizations in the Democratic party, suggested to some that the day—long predicted by Marxists—was arriving in which the American working class would finally follow in the footsteps of its European brethren. Such changes in the structure of class relations seemed to these observers to reflect the decline of opportunity and the hardening of class lines. To them, such changes could not occur without modification in the traditional value system.\n\nA close examination of the character of the American labor movement suggests that it, like American religious institutions, may be perceived as reflecting the basic values of the larger society. Although unions, like all other American institutions, have changed in various ways consistent with the growth of an urban industrial civilization, the essential traits of American trade unions, as of business corporations, may still be derived from key elements in the American value system.",

      "Passage": "The person who, with inner conviction, loathes stealing, killing, and assault, may find himself performing these acts with relative ease when commanded by authority. Behavior that is unthinkable in an individual who is acting of his own volition may be executed without hesitation when carried out under orders. An act carried out under command is, psychologically, of a profoundly different character than spontaneous action.\n\nThe important task, from the standpoint of a psychological study of obedience, is to be able to take conceptions of authority and translate them into personal experience. It is one thing to talk in abstract terms about the respective rights of the individual and of authority; it is quite another to examine a moral choice in a real situation. We all know about the philosophic problems of freedom and authority. But in every case where the problem is not merely academic there is a real person who must obey or disobey authority. All musing prior to this moment is mere speculation, and all acts of disobedience are characterized by such a moment of decisive action.\n\nWhen we move to the laboratory, the problem narrows: if an experimenter tells a subject to act with increasing severity against another person, under what conditions will the subject comply, and under what conditions will he disobey? The laboratory problem is vivid, intense, and real. It is not something apart from life, but carries to an extreme and very logical conclusion certain trends inherent in the ordinary functioning of the social world. The question arises as to whether there is any connection between what we have studied in the laboratory and the forms of obedience we have so often deplored throughout history. The differences in the two situations are, of course, enormous, yet the difference in scale, numbers, and political context may be relatively unimportant as long as certain essential features are retained.\n\nTo the degree that an absence of compulsion is present, obedience is colored by a cooperative mood; to the degree that the threat of force or punishment against the person is intimated, obedience is compelled by fear. The major problem for the individual is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of others. The difficulty this entails represents the poignant and in some degree tragic element in the situation, for nothing is bleaker than the sight of a person striving yet not fully able to control his own behavior in a situation of consequence to him.\n\nThe essence of obedience is the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another’s wishes, and he therefore no longer regards himself as culpable for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred, all of the essential features of obedience—the adjustment of thought, the freedom to engage in cruel behavior, and the types of justification experienced by the person (essentially similar whether they occur in a psychological laboratory or on the battlefield)—follow. The question of generality, therefore, is not resolved by enumerating all of the manifest differences between the psychological laboratory and other situations, but by carefully constructing a situation that captures the essence of obedience—a situation in which a person gives himself over to authority and no longer views himself as the cause of his own actions.",
